Hm, yahoogroups ate my non-text attachments, didn't it? Well, here they are
again:

http://angantyr.no-ip.org/~angantyr/kaos/gengraph.pl
http://angantyr.no-ip.org/~angantyr/kaos/gengraphinstructions.txt
http://angantyr.no-ip.org/~angantyr/kaos/01gstw.svgz

And I think I figured out what was wrong with that SVG file. Now at least
Chrome opens it too.
