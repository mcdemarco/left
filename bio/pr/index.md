I did a couple of virtual interviews during the virtual book tour for *Paramourtal*.
As noted in my [blog post update](/blog/2011/08/25/interview-with-the-writer/), one of them has since fallen off the interwebs,
so I've included a copy of it [here](realmanticMoments.html).
The other interview involved my characters, who (as usual) [hardly let me get a word in edgewise](http://sherrygloagtheheartofromance.blogspot.com/2011/08/mc-demarco-author-of-sympathy-from.html).
