<p>M. C. DeMarco lives near Boston, Massachusetts, where she writes
speculative fiction after hours.  She attended the Odyssey Fantasy Writing
Workshop in 2004 and won the NESFA 2005 Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy
Short Story Contest.  Her short stories have appeared in
the <em>Strange New Worlds 8</em>, <em>Strange New Worlds 10</em>,
<em>Paramourtal</em>, and <em>Trafficking in Magic, Magicking in Traffic</em> anthologies.</p>

<!-- trek bio 1:


M. C. DeMarco ("This Drone") caught the Star Trek bug from her father,
L. L. DeMarco, at an impressionable age.  Today she works for a small
software company in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  In 2004 she attended
the Odyssey Fantasy Writing Workshop; any adverbs that remain in her
prose are entirely her own.  This is her first professional sale.

trek bio 2:

M. C. DeMarco lives in Brookline, Massachusetts with one ailing house
plant and a wall of books.  This is her second appearance in Strange
New Worlds, and she regrets that writing about the Borg full-time is
not a viable career path.  In the Collective spirit, she acknowledges
those fellow alumni of the Odyssey Fantasy Writing Workshop who
critiqued an earlier, imperfect version of her story.

<h2>orthography</h2>

<p>I spell my name <span>m. c. de marco</span> on this website for effect
only.  In print, my last name should be spelled as one word with two
capital letters: <span class="alert">M. C. DeMarco</span>.  When using all
capital letters, the E must be typeset in small caps, thus: <span
class="alert" style="font-variant: small-caps;">M. C. DeMARCO</span>.  My
initials are <span class="alert">M.C.D.</span>  Also, <span>DeMarco</span>
should be alphabetized with the D's, between Demarais and Desmarais.
