<p>DeMarco is an Italian surname sometimes spelled <s>De Marco</s> or <s>de
Marco</s>.  Even I have spelled it that way at times, in a lifelong quest
to get the M properly capitalized.  The lowercase form "de marco" does not
occur; it is used on the site for stylistic purposes only.  I do not
take after e. e. cummings in print.</p>

<p>In traditional American orthography, this and other Italian names
should be spelled as one word with two capital letters: <span
class="alert">DeMarco</span>.  When using all capital letters, the E
must be typeset in small caps, thus: <span class="alert"
style="font-variant: small-caps;">DeMARCO</span>.</p>

<p>The initial associated with the name is <span
class="alert">D</span>, not <s>M</s>; thus my initials are <span
class="alert">M.C.D.</span> In English, the <span
class="alert">De</span> is not treated as a separable particle of
Italian names, so there is no issue of the author's choice in
alphabetization (as there sometimes is with names such as de la Mare,
which can be alphabetized under D or M, and possibly even under L,
according to the author's personal preference).
Although the inseparable particles Mc and Mac have in the past been
alphabetized apart from the rest of the M's, I have never seen this
done with <span>De</span>. <span>DeMarco</span>s are alphabetized with
the D's, between Demarais and Desmarais.</p>

<p>Note: This orthographic rule is most consistent in the case of
Italian names.  Desmarais is a French name, occasionally spelled with
an infix capital M but not often.  Spanish surnames are usually
spelled with separate particles.  Portuguese names occur in all
possible variants: da Costa, Da Costa, DaCosta, Dacosta, etc.</p>
