DeMarco<br>While protecting a soul from temptation, guardian angel Ariel encounters her rival, Forcas, a charming fallen angel. Forcus has never been much of a challenge, yet this time he is more devious than ever. To rescue her charge, Ariel learns she may have to strike a dangerous deal with this devil.<br><br>A short excerpt<br><span></span><br><span></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ariel couldn’t bear to watch. She put her head in her hands, covering her eyes. “Why couldn’t you resist temptation tonight?”<br><span></span><br><span></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A gruff but strangely familiar voice replied, “He has to give in some night or other. Why not tonight?”<br><span></span><br><span></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ariel peeked through her fingers. Across the table from her sat a demon, who must have materialized while she wasn’t watching. Short horns poked out of his shaggy black hair. He grinned, showing his fangs but also an echo of a smile she’d once known.<br><span></span><br><span></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Forcas?” <br><span></span><br><span></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Long time no see, Ariel. What’s it been—a century? Two?” <br><span></span><br><span></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “A thousand years,” she admitted. <br><span></span><br><span></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “How time flies.” <br><span></span><br><span></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She could hear his tail flicking back and forth like a whip beneath the round table, a stark contrast to his flat tone. Ariel forced herself to concentrate on her job. Sometimes you ran into a fallen angel at work. You just had to stake out your territory, not rehash the War in Heaven.<br><span></span><br><span></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Matt is still mine,” she told Forcas. “Get out of here.”<br><span></span><br><span></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He nodded toward the redhead. “And Jenny is mine, so I’m staying.” A dark beer materialized in his hand, and he drained half of it in one gulp. Ariel glanced at the mortal couple. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “She doesn’t look far gone enough to have her own guardian devil.” <br><span></span><br><span></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “She’s freshly fallen. Your fellow there is her one-way ticket to the place where the worm dies not and the fire is not quenched.” Forcas took a swig of beer and belched steam, as if quenching his own inner fires.<br><span></span><br><span></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ariel absorbed the information. “She’s married?” <br><span></span><br><span></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Unhappily. Mr. Gagnon is out of town this week.” <br><span></span><br><span></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ariel let go of the edge of the table and sat up straight and righteous.&nbsp; “I suppose you people arranged that too.” <br><span></span><br><span></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Not at all. Jenny’s issues go all the way back to her deadbeat father. She replaced him with yet another ass, and now he’s out of town, so—” <br><span></span><br><span></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “You’re tempting her to abandon her family.” Ariel sighed. As if the vagaries of life were not enough to lead mortals to sin. <br><span></span><br><span></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Perish the thought.” Forcas sat up straighter on his barstool, puffed up with devilish pride. “They don’t have kids, and she’s sinning just fine on her own. I’m just here to observe.”<br><span></span><br><span></span>Contact:<br><span></span><a href="mailto:mcd@mcdemarco.net">mcd@mcdemarco.net</a><br><span></span><br><span></span>Purchase links:<br><span></span><a href="/web/20120101232801/http://astore.amazon.com/mcdema-20">http://astore.amazon.com/mcdema-20</a><br><span></span></div> <hr style=" clear: both; visibility: hidden; width: 100%; ">  </div>
