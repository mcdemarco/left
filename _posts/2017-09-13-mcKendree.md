Today's Big Dumb Object (BDO) isn't as big and dumb as usual, but it forms an essential building block of several truly big yet scientifically feasible BDOs.  The [McKendree cylinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKendree_cylinder) is the big brother of the [O'Neill colony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Neill_cylinder) or cylinder, so I'll start there.

In 1974, Gerald O'Neill [published](http://www.nss.org/settlement/physicstoday.htm) a design for a space habitat that could be built with materials from the Moon or asteroids and would contain an Earth-like biosphere.  The cylinders would be 16 miles long and 4 miles in diameter (200 square miles of surface area each), large enough to spin for gravity without ill effects for most people.  Two cylinders would be paired for attitude control, pointing at the sun.  The surface area would be divided equally between stripes of land and of window running lengthwise (3 of each in his original design), meaning that there would only be 100 square miles of land inside.  The windows would admit indirect sunlight via mirrors and also allow heat to radiate by looking directly on space.  His design incorporates steel structure and cables, though he thought better metals might be available.

In 2000, Tom McKendree super-sized this classic design to 5 million square miles (2900 miles long by 580 miles in diameter, but only 2.5 million square miles of land due to the windows) using a new material: carbon nanotubes.  Theoretically these dimensions could be increased to 6000 miles long by 1200 miles in diameter, for an area of 24 million square miles, at least half of which would be land.  These cylinders are still intended to be paired (unless incorporated into even larger structures), so the [Orion's Arm Project](http://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/48473a892041c) suggests nesting them rather than attaching them side by side, and remarks that with even more floors a McKendree cylinder can easily rival the Earth in surface area.

[*Rendezvous With Rama*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendezvous_with_Rama) by Arthur C. Clarke features a single cylinder more than double the size of an O'Neill cylinder (and fatter) which spins for gravity.  Rama, however, is an interstellar craft with a drive system and no windows, though the layout of its artificial lighting strips is similar to O'Neill's plan.  Despite the similarities, Clarke is believed to have come up with the idea independently.
