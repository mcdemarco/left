Jo Walton asked the eternal question, *is Alternate History science fiction?* over at [Tor.com](http://www.tor.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=blog&id=27258), and suggested that there may be enough of the stuff now to count as its own genre.  I think it's still just science fiction---not nearly weighing the shelves down enough yet to qualify as a new genre.  Perhaps calling it fantasy would help with the sales and the birth of a new genre...
