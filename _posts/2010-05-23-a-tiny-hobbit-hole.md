I retweeted this a while back, but now it's made it to io9: [The perfect home for the world's tiniest hobbits](http://io9.com/5545140/the-perfect-home-for-the-worlds-tiniest-hobbits/gallery/).  It's beautiful, useless, and instructive:  with enough obsession, you can do anything--even [make a living at writing fiction](http://www.deanwesleysmith.com/?p=1121).
