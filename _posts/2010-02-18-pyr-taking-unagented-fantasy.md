Via [@sfwa](http://twitter.com/mcdemarco/status/9272955724) and [SFScope](http://sfscope.com/2010/02/pyr-now-open-to-some-unagented.html): Pyr has announced they're slushing unagented fantasy doorstops--uh, novels.

> Pyr is only reading unagented submissions in "the subgenres of epic fantasy, sword & sorcery, and contemporary/urban fantasy." Their needs for horror, science fiction, and slipstream are being met by agented submissions, so they're not opening up those subgenres to the great, unagented masses.
