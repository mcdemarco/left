[Simon & Schuster has posted](http://www.simonsays.com/content/feature.cfm?sid=44&feature_id=5768&tab=24) the table of contents for *Strange New Worlds 10*.  Congratulations to all the winners!  I snuck into the Voyager section again with "The Day the Borg Came."  

The alternates list is up in [Dean Wesley Smith's forum](http://www.deanwesleysmith.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=404) and he has a picture of the cover  [in his blog](http://deanwesleysmith.com/mt/archives/cat_blog.html#000154).  This will be the last edition of the anthology.
