Today I learned enough about Jekyll [collections](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/) to import my [recipes](/stream/recipes/) as their raw markdown source from [Penflip](http://penflip.com/mcdemarco/).  I had intended to learn some Liquid to do some post-processing that would have made them even more convenient to read here, but I only learned enough to seriously question that plan.  Fortunately, Penflip itself seems to be back in active development, despite [my initial pessimism](/blog/2013/12/15/penflipping-recipes/).

I did dust the site a bit and put up a [tombstone](/stream/springs/) for the late lamentable Springpad (where my recipes lived before Penflip).  Springpad's death has been blamed on the Boston start-up scene and the freemium model (among [other things](http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2014/05/28/five-lessons-for-consumer-tech-startups-in-springpad-shutdown/)), but I think it drove away its core user base by frequently pivoting into occupied spaces (social, Pinterest) where we didn't want to go, breaking functionality along the way.
