Via [Roy F. Moore](http://distributism.blogspot.com/2007/04/postal-service-threatens-small-press.html):  Time is running out to protest postal rate hikes affecting small publishers.  FreePress.net has a [letter-writing campaign](http://action.freepress.net/campaign/postal) you can join.<!--break-->

> Postal regulators have accepted a proposal from media giant Time Warner that would stifle small and independent publishers in America. The plan unfairly burdens smaller publishers with higher postage rates while locking in special privileges for bigger media companies.
> 
> In establishing the U.S. postal system, the nation's founders wanted to ensure that a diversity of viewpoints were available to "the whole mass of the people." Time Warner's rate increase reverses this egalitarian ideal and threatens the marketplace of ideas on which our democracy depends.
