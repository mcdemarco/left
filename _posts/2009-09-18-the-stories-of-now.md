> I say this as a happy fan and an awed colleague: the range, depth, intensity, wit and beauty of the science fiction being published in the UK these days is simply amazing. The eight wonderful writers featured here are only a representative sampling of a community of artists so strong that it is hard to explain. Add to these Brian Aldiss, Neal Asher, Iain Banks, [Stephen Baxter,] Christopher Evans, Alasdair Gray, Colin Greenland, [Nicola Griffith,] John Courtenay Grimwood, Peter Hamilton, Nick Harkaway, M. John Harrison, Robert Holdstock, Gwyneth Jones, Garry Kilworth, **Doris Lessing,**  Ian R. MacLeod, [Ken MacLeod, Paul McAulay, Ian McDonald,] China Mi√©ville, Richard Morgan, Christopher Priest, Alastair Reynolds, Adam Roberts, [Justina Robson,] Jennifer Rohn, [Geoff Ryman,] Brian Stableford, Charles Stross, Lisa Tuttle[, Ian Watson] 

Emphasis added.  The writers in parentheses are the flash authors he said to add.
