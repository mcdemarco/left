I could go into the politics behind the IJII and how I accidentally woke up ultra-modern (as I have recently [woken up Portuguese](http://www.mcdemarco.net/node/416) and even [woken up pagan](http://www.mcdemarco.net/node/423))---it didn't just come to me in the mail---but it's always easier to [quote others](http://www.jewishideas.org/node/4):

It sounds so simple.
