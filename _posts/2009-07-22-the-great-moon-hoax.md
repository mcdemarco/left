Last week at Tor:  Justin Howe reviewed a book about [The Remarkable and True Account of Life on the Moon](http://www.tor.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=blog&id=38559) which was neither.

> Matthew Goodmanâ€™s *The Sun and The Moon: the Remarkable True Account of Hoaxers, Showmen, Dueling Journalists, and Lunar Man-Bats in Nineteenth-Century New York* recounts those weeks when the city was infatuated with the Great Moon Hoax.<!--break--> The book brings together such disparate characters as Sir John Herschel, P.T. Barnum, and Edgar Allan Poe among others. Most entertaining of all, Goodman paints a vivid picture of the city at a time when editors fought not just in print but also in the streets. (Some similarities to the blogosphere can be found.)
