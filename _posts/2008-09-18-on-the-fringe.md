SFScope has a negative [review of a recent Fringe episode](http://sfscope.com/2008/09/no-explanation-necessarya-revi.html), but more interesting for locals is Paul J. Taylor's [recap of all the Boston bloopers](http://pauljtaylor.livejournal.com/223759.html) on the show (via [Universal Hub](http://www.universalhub.com/node/16550)).  He caught the Ditton/Dighton thing and speculates on a possible Stoughton/Saugus mix-up.
