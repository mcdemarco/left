Today's Big Dumb Object (BDO) is the [Rungworld](http://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/4914a713197fe), a ring-shaped ladder whose rungs I've covered before: [O'Neill colonies](/blog/2017/09/13/rama/)  (paired rotating cylindrical habitats at least 20 miles long and 5 miles in diameter) or their larger cousins, [McKendree cylinders](/blog/2017/09/14/mcKendree/), neither of which can be made much larger using known materials.  Instead, we make them bigger and dumber by attaching more than two of them together in a ladder shape.  The rungs rotate individually for gravity as usual, and the sides of the ladder serve to hold the individual cylinders in place.  We can make a smallish ring (along the lines of a Banks Orbital) this way, or a huge sun-spanning circle like a Ringworld (except feasible).

The Rungworld has not appeared in fiction outside of [Orion's Arm](http://www.orionsarm.com/xcms.php?r=oa-intro) (nor are they guaranteed to appear in the books linked above; I haven't read them yet).   Isaac Arthur also discusses Rungworlds in several of [his](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8ryqjyLBL8) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlmKejRSVd8).  He suggests using the sides of the ladder for transportation between the individual rungs.
