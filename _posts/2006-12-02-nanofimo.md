Just in case one month of writing madness was not enough, my Municipal NaNoWriMo Liaison informs me that the fun goes on at [NaNoFiMo](http://www.nanofimo.org/):

> NaNoFiMo is a challenge based on, but not affiliated with, National Novel Writing Month, or NaNoWriMo, which challenges participants to write 50,000 words in November. NaNoFiMo is a challenge to finish an existing project in December.<!--break-->  This project can be your NaNo novel or anything else, but it should be a partially written novel, not a complete draft in need of editing. (There's NaNoEdMo for that.) If you were disappointed when you found out you weren't supposed to use a work in progress for NaNoWriMo, this is the place for you and your half-written novel. If you didn't finish in NaNoWriMo, this can be your chance to redeem yourself.
