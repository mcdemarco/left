National Novel Writing Month is imminent, so I logged into [my nanowrimo account](http://www.nanowrimo.org/user/4573) today.  I found the login screen suspiciously familiar; the small print admits that the site is based on [drupal](http://www.drupal.org/).  Unfortunately it doesn't seem much faster this year than in previous years, and the forums don't appear to be searchable.  All the more time to write...<!--break-->

If, like me, you don't have a plot for your novel yet, you may want to consult [the plot FARQ](http://www.ipl.org/div/farq/plotFARQ.html).
