I've upped [Market Bucket](http://market-bucket.mcdemarco.net/), my new app.net-based grocery list app, to version 1.1.0.  The new version lets you play with some sample lists without logging in, or before creating your own if you are logged in.  There were also a few bug fixes.

I have some ideas for new features, but they'll probably be put off until the end of [NaNoWriMo](http://nanowrimo.org/).
