I've been working on updating [Scree](/tools/scree/) to Scrivener 3, using a trial version that's currently at version 3.0.3.  The latest Scrivener has lots of options, including one that can post-process text files on the command line (as long as you don't have the sandboxed Mac App Store version of Scrivener) as part of the compile process, which means no more [hacky UI scripting](/blog/2017/10/08/autoscrivener/) for me.

But there are bigger fish to fry in Scrivener 3, such as possibly leaving Twee/Scree altogether for a more direct hyperfiction writing process involving Scrivener internal document links or a non-[Twine](https://twinery.org), [pandoc](https://pandoc.org)-based [CYOA](https://github.com/semanticart/cyoa-parser/blob/master/examples/smell-ya-later.md) [format](https://github.com/semanticart/cyoa-parser), or both.
