 I heard about Bartas Technologies' [CopyWrite](http://www.bartastechnologies.com/products/copywrite/) for MacOS X in the National Novel Writing Month forums. CopyWrite can help you organize your novel chapters, notes, and scratch paper and flip through it all with one handy interface.  If you want to know more, see MacWorld's [review of CopyWrite version 2.1](http://www.macworld.com/2004/09/reviews/copywrite21/index.php).
