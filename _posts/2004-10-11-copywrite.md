 I heard about Bartas Technologies' [CopyWrite](http://www.bartastechnologies.com/products/copywrite/) for MacOS X in the [National Novel Writing Month forums](http://www.nanowrimo.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=462&forum=157&viewmode=flat&order=ASC&start=0). CopyWrite can help you organize your novel chapters, notes, and scratch paper and flip through it all with one handy interface.  If you want to know more, see MacWorld's [review of CopyWrite version 2.1](http://www.macworld.com/2004/09/reviews/copywrite21/index.php).
