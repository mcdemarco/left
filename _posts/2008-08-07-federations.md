Via [SFScope](http://sfscope.com/2008/08/john-joseph-adams-announces-op.html):  an open anthology, <em>Federations</em>, edited by John Joseph Adams, will pay 5 cents per word up to 5,000 words.

> Prime Books expects to publish it in May 2009. He describes the anthology thus: "From *Star Trek* to *Star Wars*, from *Dune* to *Foundation*, science fiction has a rich history of exploring the idea of vast intergalactic societies, and the challenges facing those living in or trying to manage such societies. The stories in Federations will continue that tradition.

The full listing is available [on his website](http://www.johnjosephadams.com/?p=1630), where you can also read about his forthcoming [zombie reprint anthology](http://www.johnjosephadams.com/?p=1538).
