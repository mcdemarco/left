Via Google (specifically, an ad slipped into my gmail clips):  [~~One Million Monkeys Typing~~](http://www.1000000monkeys.com/) is yet another community Choose Your Own Adventure site.  I link it only because it's shiny and I haven't been blogging lately, not because I've gotten far enough into any of the stories to recommend it.

### Update

You can see a story list from before the monkeys went belly-up at [the Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20100702154813/http://www.1000000monkeys.com/), but the stories are not readable.
