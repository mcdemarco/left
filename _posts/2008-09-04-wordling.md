Via [Pyr-o-mania](http://pyrsf.blogspot.com/2008/09/midwinter-wordled.html):  [Wordle](http://wordle.net/) is

> a toy for generating “word clouds” from text that you provide. The clouds give greater prominence to words that appear more frequently in the source text. You can tweak your clouds with different fonts, layouts, and color schemes. The images you create with Wordle are yours to use however you like. 

Pyr blogger Matthew Sturges Wordled his novel.  Browsing through the [Wordle gallery](http://wordle.net/gallery) I found Borges' *The Library of Babel*:

I fed it this blog, but since the RSS feed is only excerpts, it didn't have much to chew on.  So instead I fed it something else:

<a href="http://wordle.net/gallery/wrdl/163619/lorem_ipsum" 
		  title="Wordle: lorem ipsum"><img
