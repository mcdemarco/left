Dean Wesley Smith posted recently about [keeping short stories in the mail](http://deanwesleysmith.com/index.php/2008/09/17/keeping-short-stories-in-the-mail/) to high-paying markets.  I have a couple of stories which have made or almost made all the sf/f genre rounds, so his advice will come in handy as always:

> The key for many markets is in your cover letter. If I am sending a story with sf or fantasy in it to The New Yorker or Glimmer Train, I mention my literary and poetry sales in my cover letter and never once use the science fiction term.<!--break--> If I am sending a story to an airline magazine, I also stay with the more familiar stuff I have published, slanted to literary a little. In other words, I slant cover letters to the market, often changing the cover letter on the same story from market to market as it comes back and goes out.
