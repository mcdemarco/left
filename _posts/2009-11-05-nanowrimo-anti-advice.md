Via [HTLit](http://htlit.com/archives/November2009/NaNoWriMoAdvice.html):  Merlin Mann [advises against](http://www.43folders.com/2009/11/02/nanowrimo-advice) reading all that helpful plot advice I read yesterday.

Reading it all helped me, but Merlin has a good point about restricting the NaNo blog-hopping to outside your scheduled writing hours.  Nothing helps me do that quite like [Freedom](http://macfreedom.com/), a virtual license to print words.  And I can't say I've yet figured out the Twitter hashtag #amwriting.  When *I'm* tweeting, it's because I #amnotwriting. <!--break-->

The moral of this blog post:  to each his own.
