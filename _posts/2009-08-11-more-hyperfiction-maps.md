Via [Stan Carey on twitter](http://twitter.com/StanCarey/status/3246719599):  Visualizing a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure book at [Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/2009/08/11/visualizing-a-choose.html) features a pretty map of *Journey Under the Sea*.

This is far from the first such map online.  You can find [*The Cave of Time*](https://web.archive.org/web/20080923041731/http://classweb.gmu.edu/msample1/fall2005/343/caveoftime.jpg), [*The Third Planet from Altair*](http://www.ethblue.com/cyoa/), [*Sugarcane Island*](http://www.gamebooks.org/canediff.htm), and probably more out there if you look.
