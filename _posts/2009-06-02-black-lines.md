This isn't really related to science fiction; it's more of a high-tech thriller story.  Bill at Switchback [tells the tale](http://www.transit.stunningabsurdity.com/?p=343) of a construction crew that hit a buried fiber-optic cable, prompting an immediate, unexpected response from men in black SUVs:

> Georgelas assumed that he was dealing with the federal government and that the cable in question was “black” wire — a secure communications line used for some of the nation’s most secretive intelligence-gathering operations.
>
>“The construction manager was shocked,” Georgelas recalled. “He had never seen a line get cut and people show up within seconds.<!--break--> Usually you’ve got to figure out whose line it is. To garner that kind of response that quickly was amazing.”
