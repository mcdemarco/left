I got another [mysterious Honorable Mention certificate](http://www.mcdemarco.net/node/539) in the mail yesterday.  I hadn't seen my name on the Writers of the Future blog back when the finalists were announced for last quarter, but this time when I checked back [I found myself listed](http://wotfblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/final-list-of-honorable-mentions-for.html) after all.  I thought the story was pretty good, although possibly doomed by thoughtless typos, so it was a relief to find out they also thought it was passable.
