I expanded the pyramid randomization in the [Zoning Out Randomizer](https://mcdemarco.github.io/321/zoningoutrandomizer.html) to a general [Pyramid Randomizer](https://mcdemarco.github.io/321/pyramidrandomizer.html).  I was thinking about saving your selected colors, but that hasn't happened yet.  I should also move it somewhere more appropriate than a github fork of someone else's project, but that hasn't happened yet either.  Enjoy!
