Via [GeekPress](http://www.geekpress.com/2006/09/unfinished-tolkien-work-to-be.html):  The AP reports on a [new Tolkien work](http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/books/09/18/books.newtolkien.ap/index.html) to be published by Houghton Mifflin.

> "It has seemed to me for a long time that there was a good case for presenting my father's long version of the legend of the 'Children of Hurin' as an independent work, between its own covers," Christopher Tolkien said in a statement.
> 
> The new book will be published by Houghton Mifflin in the United States and HarperCollins in England.
