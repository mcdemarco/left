I've been learning Metafont from Christophe Grandsire's [Metafont Tutorial](http://metafont.tutorial.free.fr/), in order to make a font for my conscript.  It was going pretty well, except that I couldn't display the dvi proofs; I had to convert them all to PDFs instead.

Tonight I found a clue in the [MacOSX-TeX mailing list archives](http://www.esm.psu.edu/mac-tex/MacOSX-TeX-Digests/2003/MacOSX-TeX_Digest_10-06-03.html) and came up with a final solution to metafont problems:

<!--break-->

1. Run [X11](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/x11/).
2. Set the Terminal display to `:0.0` thus:
    * tcsh (pre-Panther) users type `setenv DISPLAY :0.0` or add that line to your .tcshrc file
    * bash users type `export DISPLAY=:0.0` or add that line to your .bash_profile file

Proofs should now open up automatically in xdvi under X11.
