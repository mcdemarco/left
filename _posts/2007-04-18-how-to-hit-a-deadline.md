From somewhere in the [aggregator](/aggregator/), Maureen Johnson's illustrated advice on [How to Write a Book](http://maureenjohnson.blogspot.com/2006/07/how-to-write-book.html), or more precisely, how to hit a deadline:

> This is not a guide to the long, thoughtful process of plotting, sketching, researching, and experimenting that most people think of when they think about writing books.  <!--break--> The part where people imagine we writers sit under trees in floppy hats, turning a line over and over, while someone lurks in the background playing a lute. Or some of you imagine that we are sitting in a coffee shop wearing a floppy hat, be-bopping to Starbucks jazz and letting our little fingers fly! 
> 
> No, no. That’s not what this guide is about.
> 
> This is about those last weeks and days when you really, seriously must finish the book. Really. They aren’t kidding.
