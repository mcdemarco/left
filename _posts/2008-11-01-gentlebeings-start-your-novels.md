I'm starting [NaNoWriMo](http://www.nanowrimo.org/) a little late this evening, because I was out longer that I expected to be.  Apparently there are about 100,000 aspiring novelists signed up for the 10th year of wild November drafting.  My own plan is to write 2,000 words a day, to avoid the eternal question that plagues NaNoWriMos everywhere:  Should I write 1,666 or 1,667 words today?
