From Language Log:  two posts on non-constituent titles, one that [explains the term](http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005333.html) and one with [further examples from the wild](http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005334.html), which answer the unasked question "What constitutes a title?"  

The short answer is, a brief, perhaps poetical, constituent phrase.  <!--break--> Here [Wikipedia's definition of constituent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constituent_%28linguistics%29):

> In syntactic analysis, a constituent is a word or a group of words that functions as a single unit within a hierarchical structure.

Example of constituent titles (from the first link) include *The Bourne Identity*, *Handbook of Amazonian Languages*, *Enigma*, *On the Beach*, etc.  The rare non-constituent titles include *If You*, *If On a Winter's Night a Traveller*, and *Dancer From the Dance*.  Then there are the ambiguous cases, like *The Stars My Destination* and *The Fire Next Time*, perhaps the most poetical of all.
