Via [twitter](http://twitter.com/tobiasbuckell/status/3837465156):  Tobias Bucknell's writing advice is to [cut out cable](http://www.tobiasbuckell.com/2009/09/08/letting-go-of-cable/).

> What’s funny to me is that almost every. single. person. I tell that four hours TV watching a day statistic to says without fail “Yes, but *I* don’t watch that much tv.” <!--break--> Statistically I have to imagine *someone* is lying to me! We often quite underestimate the time sink it is. To combat that, every once in a while I use a time sheet and track where I spend my time in a week, to keep myself honest. And I fall just slightly below the American average when I have cable. I fall well under it when I don’t.

I don't have a TV, so I can personally attest that getting rid of one is not a foolproof plan for writing more.  It certainly can't hurt, though.
