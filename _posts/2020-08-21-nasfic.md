The latest convention to appear online in response to the coronavirus pandemic is [NASFiC 2020](https://columbus2020nasfic.org), a three-day event starting at lunchtime (EDT) today.  This one is free and easy to register for.  Besides the usual assortment of panels, there will also be online art, dealers, and participatory music.  Gaming seems to be being coordinated in a Discord channel.  We've set up a little KonOpas [here](http://nasfic.mcdemarco.net/) to have a mobile-ready schedule just like a real con.

[NASFiC](https://www.nasfic.org) is an American convention that occurs whenever the World Science Fiction Convention is abroad---apparently even when both of them are virtual.
