I've been trying to catch up on the [aggregator](/aggregator), and one interesting old link I found was a [Tor.com post](http://www.tor.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=blog&id=10665) from mid-December about Verlyn Flieger’s "Tolkien and the Idea of the Book":

> [T]he Red Book of Westmarch was modeled in name after "the great medieval manuscript books whose names sound like an Andrew Lang color series for the Middle Ages . . . most important(ly) . . . the real Red Book of Hergest."  Yet Tolkien’s Red Book is more coherent narratively and more specifically traceable back to earlier manuscripts than most of these.<!--break--> These qualities were not always present: it was not until the second edition of *LotR* that the Red Book covered history as far back as the First Age, or was given a line of named "author-redactors," or was said to consist of the hobbits’ personal diaries *plus* Bilbo’s three annexed volumes.

I suppose I'm so accustomed to the idea of the author as translator of some rare and marvellous text that I missed the fact that with Tolkien, as always, it's so much more complicated than it looks at first glance.
