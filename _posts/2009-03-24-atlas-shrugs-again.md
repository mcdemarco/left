Via [io9](http://io9.com/5167528/economic-crisis-pushes-people-to-buy-ayn-rand-novel):  sales of Ayn Rand's socialist apocalypse, *Atlas Shrugged,* are rising as the economy tanks.  Quoting *The Guardian*:

> The book's peak sales days on Amazon seem to correspond to major events in the attempted rescue of the economy, including the bailout of Northern Rock, the US decision to buy shares in nine major banks, and the passing of Obama's stimulus bill. The Ayn Rand Centre for Individual Rights claims that US-wide sales almost tripled over the first seven weeks of 2009, compared with the same period in 2008.
