I got some stacking counters to use for suit chips for Decktet games, but when I went to play [Magnate](http://decktet.wikidot.com/game:magnate), I couldn't find my old D&D dice.  So I made a little tool to roll for me:  [Magnate Roller](/games/decktet/magnate/).  I used Vue.js just in case I ever decide to expand it into the full game.

Peter and I tied our first game (including tying on the tie-breaker).
