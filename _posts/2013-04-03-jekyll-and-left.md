[Octopress](http://octopress.org/) was repressing me, so I switched to a pure [jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) responsive theme called [Left](http://zachholman.com/posts/left/).  I've hacked it up a bit with navigation submenus, header rearrangements, and a simpler mobile stylesheet.  The source code is in my [github fork](https://github.com/mcdemarco/left).

I also managed to import my Drupal database, with some technical difficulties involving base64 and Drupal books that required semi-manual repair.  Most of the static website has also been converted to ... static website.
