 Kate Nepveu did a nice [Live From Noreascon](http://noreascon4.blogs.com/live/) write-up about the [Fantasy of Manners panel](http://noreascon4.blogs.com/live/2004/09/panel_report_fa.html)  (Lois McMaster Bujold, Ellen Kushner, Jo Walton and Madeleine E. Robins moderating).  I missed that and many other panels; I wish more of this sort of detailed panel coverage had shown up in the blog.
