Today's Big Dumb Object (BDO) is an [Alderson Disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alderson_disk), a finite plane with a sun in a hole at its center.  The invention of Dan Alderson, it was popularized in [Larry Niven's classic megastructures essay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigger_Than_Worlds), where he also mentions bobbing the sun up and down to replace the perpetual twilight with actual night and day, and the necessity of a wall to retain the atmosphere at the inner edge.
