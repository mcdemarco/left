 It's not too late to help out with Strange Horizons' [September 2004 Fund Drive](http://www.strangehorizons.com/fund_drives/200409/main.shtml):

> Strange Horizons has always depended on donations from our readers to
> keep our publication going. Our staff doesn't get paid, but our
> contributors do, and paying professional rates for high-quality
> fiction, poetry, art, and non-fiction takes a lot of resources.
