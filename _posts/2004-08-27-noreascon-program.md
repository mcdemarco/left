 A [schedule](https://web.archive.org/web/20041020014018/http://www.noreascon.com/schedule/) is now up at the Noreascon site.  They also have a [news blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20040929083328/http://noreascon4.blogs.com/news/) and several other blogs listed in its sidebar.  If you're already in or around Boston, check out the [local gopher needs](https://web.archive.org/web/20041026154644/http://www.noreascon.com/volunteers/local-gophers.html) page as well.
