The [announcement from Sub-Q](https://sub-q.com/announcing-sub-q-jam-a-game-jam-and-limited-submission-window-from-sub-q-magazine/) includes two options, the actual game jam [at itch.io](https://itch.io/jam/subqjam), or a proposal option similar to their usual proposal submission process.  The theme is love of any sort, and there's a word limit: the interactive stories can present only 1000 words of content to the user.

I'm thinking of it as a flash fiction market on that account, and I'm hoping it also means that the usual structural requirements (or heavy-handed suggestions, if you prefer) one finds in hypertext markets like Sub-Q and Choice of Games won't apply---so I may even submit.  If you're new to interactive fiction, they sound quite supportive and you should probably try it, too.
