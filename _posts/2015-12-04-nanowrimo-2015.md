Another year, another NaNo:  this was my twelfth [National Novel Writing Month](http://www.nanowrimo.org/), and my twelfth victory.  (I took a two-year vacation a couple of years ago.)

The NaNoWriMo forums were dull again this year, presumably due to the strict regulation of threads.  The entire month of [Scrivener](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php) discussion was once again crammed into one infinitely long and not particularly informative [thread](http://nanowrimo.org/forums/nano-technology/threads/251708).  (I used Scrivener again this year.)

It was a good year for mapping software, though; I discovered a nice [island generator](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/polygon-map-generation/demo.html) and the amazing [Inkarnate](http://inkarnate.com/) in the forums (plus more Inkarnate examples [on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/inkarnate/)).  In the end, though, I just used Gimp to tweak a pre-existing map.

I was also inspired by the (one) conlanging thread in the forums both to start reading the [conlangs subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/) instead and to google for an automatic conlang generator---just in case someone had written one I could use for a short visit by my characters to a distant port.  And thus I discovered [Gleb](http://gleb.000024.org).  (Scroll down if you don't see the sample words there.)  You need some familiarity with the International Phonetic Alphabet to get much out of Gleb.  There's a little more information about it at [GitHub](https://github.com/alexfink/random_language).

The timeline software discussion escaped into more than one thread, in one of which I offered some alternatives to [Aeon Timeline](http://www.scribblecode.com), which has still not been updated with the [update](http://www.scribblecode.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=565) that might, possibly, enable it to handle my relatively tame fantasy calendar.  Here are the timeline software suggestions I posted there:

* [Timeliner](https://www.technotarek.com/timeliner/) features vertical styling and [an optional Sci-Fi theme](http://www.jqueryscript.net/demo/Interactive-Accessible-jQuery-Timeline-Plugin-Timeliner/demo-future/)
* [Timesheet.js](http://sbstjn.github.io/timesheet.js/) looks like a Gantt chart and might be especially useful for plotting (but only at the whole-day level)
* [TimelineJS (3)](http://timeline.knightlab.com/) can take its data from a Google spreadsheet
* [More suggestions](http://writers.stackexchange.com/questions/2082/is-there-any-good-time-line-software-out-there) from the writers StackExchange

For cat-vacuuming distraction, I fiddled a bit with Timesheet.js, then gave up on it.  I was thinking about writing my own timeline software, since I'm not sure I'd want to use Aeon Timeline even if it could handle my calendar---I prefer lightweight, text-based tools---but instead I mostly worked on my map (which I actually needed, as my characters were traveling farther than usual) and added nautical terms to my (unpublished) conlang dictionary.  I also read about recent developments in mythicism, which I hadn't read much about since G. A. Wells and which was completely unrelated to my novel.

And, of course, in the little free time I had remaining, I wrote 50,000 words.  Although I was expecting to end up with my usual half of a fantasy novel this year, I got very close to the end---or at least to a possible end---of my plot.  So perhaps I have written that elusive novella, or perhaps I should really go straight into the action-packed sequel without pretending that the novel actually ended.  One indication that the plot should go on is that I can't imagine my characters would go home for a break; I think they'd do the next obvious thing right away.
