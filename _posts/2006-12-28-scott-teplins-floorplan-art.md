> For a while now, [Scott Teplin]'s been doing drawings of three dimensional letters, filled with different substances. This has evolved into letters and abstract shapes drawn as axiometric floorplans for strange clubhouses filled with mysterious and enigmatic devices. It's like detention-room doodling, done by a pre-adolescent supervillain.

Here's a [thumbnail gallery](http://www.teplin.com/HEAVY_WATER/thumbnails.html) of his upcoming [g-module show](http://www.g-module.com/PGS/exhibition_full.htm).  I thought those or his [28 Rooms](http://www.teplin.com/28rooms/index.html) might inspire some interesting writing exercises.<!--break-->
