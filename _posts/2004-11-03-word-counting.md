 I found [NaNoCount](http://paulgorman.org/index.php?p=53), a word counter for TextEdit through the NaNoWriMo forums.  Though I use a mac, my writing all happens in Emacs.  I wanted a running word counter for Emacs, and I found wcount.el  [here](http://gnufans.net/~deego/emacspub/site-lisp-not/wcount.el). There's also a tex version, [tex-wcount.el](http://ftp2.de.freebsd.org/pub/emacs/emacs-lisp/archive/tex-wcount.el), which requires detex.
