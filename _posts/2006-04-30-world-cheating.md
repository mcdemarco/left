Holly Lisle has lots of exercises and essays about writing at [her website](http://hollylisle.com/), and even a [podcast](http://hollylisle.libsyn.com/rss).  I was reading the one about worldbuilding, [How Much of My World Do I Build:  A Workshop for New Writers, Underbuilders, AND Overbuilders](http://hollylisle.com/fm/Workshops/how-much-do-i-build-workshop.html) when I got distracted by a statement about the lack of world-building software:<!--break-->

> If you're working in fantasy or SF, you are pretty much on your own. No programs exist to create maps for you, nor should they -- neither names nor geographical details would be well-served by an automated solution. The feel of your world will be determined by these things, and they shouldn't come from a cookie-cutter program.

Holly Lisle has some wonderful handmade maps--big color ones linked in the essay above, or monochrome ones like [the world of Korre](http://hollylisle.com/jpg/tonk_korre_map_small.jpg)--but there is software out there for those who want to cheat at world-building.  

The first thing I found by googling was a suite from [ProFantasy Software](http://www.profantasy.com/).  [NBOS Software](http://www.nbos.com/) has a similar product line.  Check out my [mapping](/blog/tags/mapping/) and [Terragen](/blog/tags/terragen/) categories for some free options.
