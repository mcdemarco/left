Sorry about the lack of posts recently.  Service should be restored by next week.

In local news, there will be a bone marrow drive at Kehillath Israel in Coolidge Corner (384 Harvard Street, Brookline, MA) this Sunday and Monday.  See the [Gift of Life website](http://www.giftoflife.org/Pages/Upcoming-Donor-Drives.aspx) for more details.
