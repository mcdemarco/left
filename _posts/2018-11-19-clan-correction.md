During NaNoWriMo 2013, I wrote a [Random Family Tree Generator](/tools/family-tree-generator/lineage.html) in order to auto-generate characters, and later expanded it in 2014.  I opened it up this NaNoWriMo and immediately noticed a bug involving the clan dropdowns (for those humans and fantasy species with clans), which I never noticed before because I either go straight to my custom species or I use random clans---and which would never have happened if I had just started fresh on it with a framework rather than basing it on even older code.   The bug is now fixed.
