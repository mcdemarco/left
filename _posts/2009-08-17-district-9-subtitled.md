Jon Evans at [Tor.com](http://www.tor.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=blog&id=51552) explains some of the South African cultural references in *District 9*:

> **District Six.** A famous ghetto in Cape Town, always South Africa’s most liberal city, in which people of all races coexisted harmoniously even during the apartheid years. In the 1970s, more than 60,000 people were forcibly removed from the district and resettled elsewhere, on the grounds that interracial interaction bred conflict. Cape Town’s District Six Museum maintains a memorial to that shattered community, and the title of District 9 is almost certainly a nod to District Six.
