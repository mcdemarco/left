[NaNoWriMo](http://nanowrimo.org) is coming! 

A few days ago I discovered a new tool, [Pacemaker Planner](https://pacemaker.press), in the [NaNoWriMo forums](http://nanowrimo.org/forums/helpful-resources-sites/threads/384225) (registration required, and click quickly; they think it's a good idea to delete the forums every year and start over in ignorance).  Pacemaker Planner is an online tool for setting daily word count goals and tracking your word count.  I usually do that with a spreadsheet, but Pacemaker does more and more easily.  They have some presets for NaNoWriMo, and a nice UI for tweaking your plan if you're doing something differently than the traditional 1,666 &#8532; words-a-day plan.

For laughs, I decided to try a "biting the bullet" plan with some modifications for the weekend, which you can see in gory detail [at Pacemaker Press](https://pacemaker.press/users/mcd/plans/nano-2016), or in overview right here:
