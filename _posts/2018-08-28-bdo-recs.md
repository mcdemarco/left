Via [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/99esi8/favorite_big_dumb_object_tales/) again:  Today's Big Dumb Object (BDO) non-story is a thread at Reddit about favorite BDOs.  Some of the BDOs aren't (*e.g., Anathem*) and others I haven't read so I can't vouch for their being actual BDOs (yet):  *Blame*, *Marrow!*, *The Architects of Hyperspace*, *The Stars Are Legion*, *The Expanse*, *Grand Central Arena*, *Confluence*, *Vast*, *Rogue Moon* (an oldie), *Dark Orbit*, *ShipStar* (Larry Niven and Greg Benford), and *Strata* (Terry Prachett).
