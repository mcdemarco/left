Via [GeekPress](http://www.geekpress.com/2006/09/despite-rumors-black-hole-factory-will.html):    LiveScience reports that [Despite Rumors, Black Hole Factory Will Not Destroy Earth](http://www.livescience.com/forcesofnature/060919_black_holes.html).

> Scientists could generate a black hole as often as every second when the world's most powerful particle accelerator comes online in 2007.
> 
> This potential "black hole factory" has raised fears that a stray black hole could devour our planet whole. The Lifeboat Foundation, a nonprofit organization devoted to safeguarding humanity from what it considers threats to our existence, has stated that artificial black holes could "threaten all life on Earth" and so it proposes to set up "self-sustaining colonies elsewhere."

> But the chance of planetary annihilation by this means "is totally miniscule," experimental physicist Greg Landsberg at Brown University in Providence, R.I., told _LiveScience_.
