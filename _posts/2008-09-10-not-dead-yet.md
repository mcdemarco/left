If you look quickly, you may see [Google being sucked into the planet-eating black hole](http://www.google.com/) created by the Large Hadron Collider today.  (If you were too slow, try the [Google holiday logos](http://www.google.com/intl/en/holidaylogos.html) page.)  See [The Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2008/sep/08/particlephysics.physics) for a short intro to the death-by-sucking-black-hole theory, and [Astroengine](http://www.astroengine.com/?p=1240) for an equally-brief debunking:

> THE LHC WILL NOT HURT ANYONE, IT WILL NOT DESTROY THE EARTH, IT WONâ€™T EVEN DISRUPT YOUR CELLPHONE SIGNAL. THE LARGE HADRON COLLIDER IS SAFE.

So far, so good, anyway.  Thanks to [digg space](/aggregator/sources/40) for both links.

This just in from various sources:  [Has the Large Hadron Collider destroyed the world yet?](http://hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com/)
