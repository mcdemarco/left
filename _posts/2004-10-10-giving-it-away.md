 From Writers' Weekly:  [10 Ways to Respond to Non-Paying Pubs' Excuses](http://www.writersweekly.com/the_latest_from_angelahoycom/002046_09292004.html) by Angela Hoy.  Thanks to [sf-f.org](http://sf-f.org/index.php?p=forView&id=1868) for the link.

Although I write regularly for a non-paying publication, I lean towards the "don't give it away for free" school of thought.  Unless there's some tangible benefit in it for me, I'd rather put my stories up here on my own site as sell them to some low-end zine for $5 or $10.
