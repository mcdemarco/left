Via [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/tag/scifi):  The New York Times reviews [_James Tiptree Jr.: The Double Life of Alice B. Sheldon_](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/03/books/03masl.html?th&emc=th) by Julie Phillips.

> In 1967, when Alice B. Sheldon was 51, she spied a jar of Tiptree jam in a grocery store near her Virginia home. This was arguably the pivotal moment in her life. She morphed Tiptree jam into a name: James Tiptree. Her husband added a "Junior." They laughed. Then she attached the name James Tiptree Jr. to some science fiction stories she had written and put them in the mail. And one of the strangest careers in the already weird world of sci-fi was born.
