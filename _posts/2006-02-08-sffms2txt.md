Last night when I should have been sleeping, I was writing [sffms2txt](/sffms/sffms2txt/), a LaTeX-to-plain text converter for [sffms](/sffms/info/AboutSFFMS.html) or other simple LaTeX files--ostensibly so that I can send one of my stories to a market that requires plain text submissions.

The one exciting feature of sffms2txt that sets it above [detex](http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/trinkle/detex/) and [query replace](http://theory.uwinnipeg.ca/gnu/emacs/emacs_91.html) is the choice of pseudo-italics:  <!--break-->

* `*single asterisks*`
* `**double asterisks**` 
* `_single underscores_`
* ` __double underscores__`
*  or no distinguishing markup at all

The php source is available upon request.
