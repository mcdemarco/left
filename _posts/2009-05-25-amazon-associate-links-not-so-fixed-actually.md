I noticed a while back that my Amazon Associate links were no longer showing up in the sidebar; they seem to have dropped out of the posts where I've used them as well.  I certainly haven't updated drupal, though I have switched browsers.  In any event, I couldn't get the iframes to display with minimal tweaking, so instead I gave up and grabbed the images out of my [Amazon store](http://astore.amazon.com/mcdema-20).  Shopping may now resume...
