I blogged last month about Clarkesworld Magazine [reopening to submissions](http://www.mcdemarco.net/node/491).  Sunday is my new submission day, so today I picked a story of (barely) less than 4,000 words to send to them.   Their [new submissions system](http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/submissions_tracker/index.php) was surprisingly high-tech.  It's not just prettier than everything else out there; it even tells you where your submission is in the queue.
