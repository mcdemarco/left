> A study by anthropologists has explored the origins of folk tales and traced the relationship between varients of the stories recounted by cultures around the world.
>
> The researchers adopted techniques used by biologists to create the taxonomic tree of life, which shows how every species comes from a common ancestor.<!--break-->
>
> Dr Jamie Tehrani, a cultural anthropologist at Durham University, studied 35 versions of Little Red Riding Hood from around the world.
