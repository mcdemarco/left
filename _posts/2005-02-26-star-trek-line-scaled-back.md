On [the psiphi message board](http://www.comicboards.com/psiphiboards/startrek/view.php?rpl=050221150432) Marco Palmieri confirmed that Pocket Books' Star Trek line will be cut back to one mass-market paperback per month, beginning in June.  Hardcovers and trade paperbacks (e.g., *Strange New Worlds*) are unaffected.  Much discussion of the change can be found at [TrekBBS](http://www.trekbbs.com/threads/showflat.php?Cat=&Board=UBB17&Number=4036745&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5&o=7&fpart=all).

I'd heard rumors to this effect already, so I've scaled back any hopes I might have had of writing more Star Trek.
