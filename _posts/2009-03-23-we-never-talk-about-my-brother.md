Also at io9, a [review of Peter S. Beagle's new short story collection](http://io9.com/5165314/peter-s-beagle-soars-with-we-never-talk-about-my-brother):

> For decades, musician and author Peter S. Beagle has been hailed as the finest living American writer of fantasy. Now Tachyon Publications has released his latest collection of stories, *We Never Talk About My Brother*.<!--break-->
>
> Beagle is most well known for two classic novels written at the very beginning of his career, neither of which have ever been out of print. *The Last Unicorn* is probably his most famous and beloved, but I feel *A Fine and Private Place* is the better book-a truly timeless classic.
