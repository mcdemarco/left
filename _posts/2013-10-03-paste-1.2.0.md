Yesterday I updated my app.net clipboard [Paste](http://paste-app.net/) again, to version 1.2.0.
Paste now supports optional paste titles, types, and tags, plus paging through your old pastes.

For the innards of Paste, I started using mustache.js (a temporary expedient), and recompiled highlight.js to highlight
more languages.  I spruced up the buttons and fixed a button-related bug that was only bothering me.  
The to-do list at the moment is:

* Add an app cache.
* Optional message descriptions.
* Longer pastes (using the ADN files API).
* Private pastes and multiple paste channels.

(Due to the sad state of the app economy, *profit!!!* has been removed from the to-do list.)
