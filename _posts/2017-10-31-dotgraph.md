[DotGraph](/tools/scree/dotgraph/) got a little bug fix today.  I found a subtle issue with tag display while de-scripting my Twine hyperfiction novel, which turned out to be one old (and therefore undefined) variable that I'd missed in the big refactor.

I was using temporary tags to mark where story variables got set and used, to see whether they were necessary at all (some weren't), and if so, what the simplest way would be to break up the tree based on the possible values (mostly booleans).  Normally I use tags for the current setting/chunk of the story, so it was easy to switch the tag back based on context after I'd used it; it didn't occur to me to use (Scrivener) ~~labels~~ statuses, but that could have worked even better with some tweaking.  I feel a version 2.0.5 coming on...
