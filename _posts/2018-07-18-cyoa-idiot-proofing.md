I've been reading more choice fiction lately, and one thing I noticed in the last two books I started (*Fifty Shades of Plaid* by Parody Brothers, [Kindle Unlimited](https://www.amazon.com/Fifty-Shades-Grey-Parody-shades-ebook/dp/B00KFXUWTG//ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&linkCode=li2&tag=mcdema-20&linkId=474dfb9b433e59487a744a92a5a1780f) 2014 and *How to Be Bad* by Michael La Ronn, [ePub](https://www.goodreads.com/ebooks/download/22376987-how-to-be-bad) 2014) was the idiot-proofing.  It has moved beyond the usual blurb at the beginning telling you how to read a CYOA, to an *entire page* after *every choice* warning you that if you can see this, you forgot to make a choice.  Apparently the temptation to flip pages in an eReader is irresistible, at least when compared to the minor price in wasted bits backstopping all your choices.  Maybe I'll add a per-passage warning option to [PrePub](/tools/scree/prepub/)...
