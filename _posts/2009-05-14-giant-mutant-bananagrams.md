I was at [Porter Square Books](http://www.portersquarebooks.com/) tonight and I saw a basket of what looked like giant mutant bananagrams.  I don't see them on [BoardGameGeek](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/27225) or even [the Bananagrams website](http://www.bananagrams-intl.com/index-us.asp), so I feel the need to report my discovery to the world.  Giant Mutant Bananagrams look just like the regular banana-shaped bag of tiles, but twice as big.  The label says 2--16 players.  I can't imagine sixteen people shouting "Peel!" at once...
