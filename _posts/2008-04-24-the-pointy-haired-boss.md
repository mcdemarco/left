This entry was intended to be a sequel to a previous entry about [genetically engineered vampires](http://www.mcdemarco.net/node/401), but I forgot to finish my thought and all that remains of it is a cool quote from the extended notes to *Blindsight* by Peter Watts:

> In fact, the nonconscious mind usually works so well on its own that it actually employs a gatekeeper in the anterious cingulate cortex to do nothing but prevent the conscious self from interfering in daily operations.  (If the rest of your brain were conscious, it would probably regard you as the pointy-haired boss from Dilbert.)<!--break-->
