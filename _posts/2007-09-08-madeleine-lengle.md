I heard her speak many years ago, long before Harry Potter brought the notion of a blockbuster to children's literature.  Later when I read Harry Potter, my first thought was *this is not Madeleine L'Engle, or Ursula LeGuin, Lloyd Alexander or C. S. Lewis.*  No one stood in line all night waiting for her next book, but Madeleine L'Engle was one of the best children's writers in an age of great books.
