I came up with a new pyramid game variant while searching for the origin of [a cool square Tarot deck](https://www.ariwisner.com/trinity-tarot) I spotted in the [Gnostica image gallery at BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/7539593/gnostica).  At closer examination, it wasn't ideal for use in Gnostica or Zarcana because too many of the major arcana were renamed---and who would want to mark up such a pretty deck?  There aren't many other square decks; I found only the [Insecta Obscura tarot](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1328504870/insecta-obscura-tarot-deck-green-witch) and the AI-assisted [Caticorn tarot](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1678144111/the-caticorn-tarot).  But along the way, I stumbled across some less problematic [round](https://www.llewellyn.com/product.php?ean=9780738772141) [decks](https://www.usgamesinc.com/motherpeace_round_tarot_deck.html), and a dreadful idea was born: **Hexcana**.

Ideally Hexcana would be played with a [hexagonal](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1715803530/the-renaissance-hexagon-tarot) [tarot](https://theentanglementtarot.com/gallery) [deck](https://tarotator.com/hexa-tarot-preview/), but these range from expensive to vaporware; many apparent hex tarot are merely tarot-adjacent and inadequate for playing Zarcana-style games.  Fortunately, circles will do to make a hex board instead of the usual Zarcana-style grid.

At first I conceived of Hexcana as a Gnostica variant, but adding two new directions seemed too likely to tip the perfect balance of the game.  Whereas tossing new cray-cray into Zarcana seemed more in the spirit of the game.  Thus, Hexcana is [Zarcana](https://www.looneylabs.com/content/zarcana) played on a hex grid.  All rules are the same, except that there are six orthogonal directions, and the opening layout should consist of seven round Tarot cards in a hex formation.

Playtesting will have to wait for the acquisition of a round Tarot deck and a live Zarcana ~~victim~~ partner.

Since my last gaming post, but still a few months ago, I also added Jacynth City (yet another Zark City variant) to my [Decktet](/games/decktet/) and [pyramid games](/games/pyramids/) lists.  Today I am also posting the draft rules of [Darcana](/games/decktet/darcana/), a reimplementation of Dectana with more Gnostica, less Zarcana, and a solo/automata mode.
