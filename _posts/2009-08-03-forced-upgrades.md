Due to the unfortunate demise of my old hard drive, I have upgraded to a MacBook Pro and Leopard.  I'm still not fully moved into the new mac, so I haven't been blogging much.  I may post the full hard- and software saga at some point, but for now I'll just say the multitouch trackpad is the best part.

You can always [follow me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/mcdemarco) for more timely (if more lightweight) updates.
