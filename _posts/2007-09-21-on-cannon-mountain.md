At Making Light, Jim Macdonald [debunks a classic alien abduction story](http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/009378.html) at, I must warn the reader, great length:

> Today [September 19, 2007], this very day, forty-six years ago, Betty and Barney Hill drove down U.S. 3, right past my house and into history. They were about to become Patient Zero for Alien Abductions with Weird Medical Experiments, Missing Time, and Big-Eyed Extraterrestrials. <!--break--> The first and (we are told) best documented case of Alien Abduction Evah. There was a book. There was made-for-TV movie. Magazine articles. Mentions in other books. Close Encounters of the First Kind. X-Files.
