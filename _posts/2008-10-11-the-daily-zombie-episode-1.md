I've escalated the zombie research in preparation for NaNoWriMo.  Here are some links:

* Via [Futurismic](http://futurismic.com/2008/10/10/friday-free-fiction-for-10th-october/), a zombie flash story [Chip Heads](http://www.garethlpowell.com/friday-flash-fiction-45/)
* [io9's zombie category](http://io9.com/tag/zombies/), with plenty of meaty zombie linkage<!--break-->
* a [zombie thread](http://www.nanowrimo.org/eng/node/3015085) in the NaNo forums, in which aspiring zombie novelists classify their zombies

Mine are medium speed, intelligent, viral, and pre-apocalyptic.
