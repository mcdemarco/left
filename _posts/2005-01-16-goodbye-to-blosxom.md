I've converted the blog from blosxom to [drupal](http://drupal.org).  Blosxom was lovely in its purity, but it wasn't helping me blog or keep up with other writing blogs.  With drupal, I can run my own feed reader on-site and instantly link-blog the posts that interest me.  And _drupal_ is easier to spell than _blosxom_.

I'm planning to convert the entire site to drupal eventually, and at that point the links will change.
