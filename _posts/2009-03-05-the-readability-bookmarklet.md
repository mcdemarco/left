Via [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/03/03/readability):  the [arc90 lab announces](http://lab.arc90.com/2009/03/readability.php) a customizable bookmarklet called [Readability](http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/) that will turn almost any cluttered website into a cleaner, sparser, more readable page.
