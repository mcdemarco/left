Via [del.icio.us sf](/aggregator/sources/24) again:  [Wired](http://www.wired.com/culture/art/magazine/16-09/mf_stephenson?currentPage=all) has an article about Neal Stephenson, his new book *Anathem*, his steampunk phase, and even his breakout with *Snow Crash*.

> His early books, a satire about big universities and an eco-thriller, were well received but not huge sellers. In search of big sales and big bucks, he collaborated with an uncle on a couple of political potboilers. "We heard that Tom Clancy had made something like $17 million the previous year and thought if we could snag 1 percent of that, we'd still be OK." <!--break-->They didn't come close, and in 1991, Stephenson says, his career "was moving along at low rpms." Then he wrote *Snow Crash*, a book that postulated the Metaverse, an exquisitely fleshed-out vision of a digital alternative world, and Stephenson found himself at the front ranks of cyberpunk authors. "I was sort of going for broke with *Snow Crash*," he told me a few years back. "I had tried to write stuff that was more conventional and that would be appealing to a large audience, and it didn't work. I figured I would just go for broke, write something really weird, and not be so worried about whether it was a good career move or not."
