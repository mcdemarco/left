Bruce Baugh at Tor.com has [a retrospective on the work of the late David Eddings](http://www.tor.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=blog&id=31896):

> David Eddings passed away yesterday, at the age of 77. At the risk of sounding cliched, heâ€™ll be missed.
>
>He wrote epic quest fantasy in the grand style, with heroes who discover unsuspected destinies, companions who ply their various specialties on behalf of the hero and their shared missions, highly-placed evil schemers, and the lot.
