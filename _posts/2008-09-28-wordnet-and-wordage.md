I was checking for updates to [WordNet](http://wordnet.princeton.edu/), a thesaurus program that I use, when I found a similar tool on-line:  [Wordage](http://wordage.info/).  There's no explicit information there about the dictionaries behind the Wordage interface, but I suspect WordNet was involved.  Wordage looks very handy, especially compared to the current state of WordNet usability.

WordNet is now at version 3.0 and has a [rudimentary web interface](http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn).  Matters are not so promising if you want to download the dictionary for offline use.<!--break-->  The [sourceforge page for the mac port](http://wordnet.sourceforge.net/) seems to be dead, although you can still get version 2.0 of the mac port from the [Internet Archive](http://www.archive.org/details/tucows_337822_WordNet).  The Windows port is similarly [mired at version 2.1](http://wordnet.princeton.edu/obtain).

The user is instead invited to [build 3.0 himself](http://wordnet.princeton.edu/obtain) for mac or unix systems.  This is something I would attempt if I had the time, but I'll have to stick to the web versions for now.
