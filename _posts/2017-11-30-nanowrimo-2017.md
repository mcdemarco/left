Another year, another NaNo:  this was my fourteenth [National Novel Writing Month](http://www.nanowrimo.org/), and my fourteenth victory.  (I took a two-year vacation a few years ago.)

The NaNoWriMo forums continue to suffer from strict regulation of threads.  The entire month of [Scrivener](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php) discussion was once again crammed into one infinitely long and not particularly informative [thread](https://nanowrimo.org/forums/nano-technology/threads/414752), while any separate requests for information were immediately locked, with advice to ask in the Scrivener thread.  I used Scrivener again this year, in combination with my gamebook project template, [Scree](/tools/scree/).

I wrote [earlier](/blog/2017/11/01/lets-nano/) about getting started up this year on another hyperfiction story, still using Scree, Scrivener, and Twine.  Once again it started out much easier than a linear novel, but about halfway in the overhead in complexity began to cut into my lead.  I didn't need to untangle too much, but I did try, not always successfully, to reunite the diverging threads of my plots.  One major simplifying factor was the two-part structure of the novel, where if you survived the apocalypse, you got to participate in some brave new world thread which, despite not being a single bottleneck, turned out to be a sort of simplifying reset button regardless.

For cat-vacuuming distraction, I made several improvements to [DotGraph](/tools/scree/dotgraph/), some of which I blogged along the way and some of which I still need to release, and started on a new format, [PrePub](/tools/scree/prepub/) for (eventually) converting my stories to ePub format.  Early on in the month I even [reviewed](/blog/2017/11/04/state-of-the-cyoa-art/) a few print hyperfiction books, before my word count dipped below on-schedule.
