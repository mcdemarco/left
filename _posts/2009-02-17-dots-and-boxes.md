I went to [Eureka](http://www.eurekapuzzles.com/)'s almost-weekly games night in Brookline tonight, where the topic of the evening was the pen-and-paper game dots and boxes.  Elwyn Berlekamp, author of [The Dots and Boxes Game](http://www.akpeters.com/product.asp?ProdCode=1292), spoke about the game, including strategies, theorems, and the dual of the game (strings and coins).<!--break-->  If you don't want to spring for the book, you can try the links on this [dots-and-boxes analysis index](http://homepages.cae.wisc.edu/~dwilson/boxes/).

Berlekamp also spoke briefly about his book [Mathematical Go](http://www.akpeters.com/product.asp?ProdCode=0326) and the history of Go.
