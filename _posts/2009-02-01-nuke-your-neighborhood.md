Via [Tor.com](http://www.tor.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=blog&id=11645):  you can nuke your neighborhood at [Ground Zero](http://www.carloslabs.com/projects/200712B/GroundZero.html), an unholy marriage of Google Maps and nuclear weapons.  For various kilotonnages, the map shows which neighborhoods will be depopulated and which will get off easy with 2nd degree burns.  The asteroid impact option especially is not to be missed.
