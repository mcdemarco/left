Via a mailing list:  [Victoria Strauss debunks](http://accrispin.blogspot.com/2008/06/victoria-strauss-fake-contest-alert.html#link) a fake [SFWA](http://www.sfwa.org/news/2008/boguswritingcontest.htm) contest.

> I can only imagine the number of hopeful writers who will be enticed by the SFWA name, not to mention the promise of enormous prizes plus a commercial publishing credit. Once again, however: **this contest is a fake**.<!--break--> I've confirmed this with SFWA's president, Michael Capobianco, but to anyone who's familiar with SFWA, the bogusness is obvious.
