[Scree](/tools/scree/), my Scrivener template for writing hyperfiction with Twine/Twee, and [DotGraph](/tools/scree/dotgraph/), my Twine proofing format for graphing stories in the style of the classic [Chimney Rock map](http://www.seanmichaelragan.com/html/%5B2008-03-07%5D_Choose_Your_Own_Adventure_book_as_directed_graph.shtml), have had minor version bumps:  Scree to handle tags and improve layout when importing to Twine 2, and DotGraph to identify unreachable passages.

Note that Scrivener is having its annual [free trial for NaNoWriMo](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/nanowrimo.php) again this November.  If you try it and like it, NaNo participants get a discount, with a bigger discount for winners.
