 I was wondering whether there's still a market for Choose Your Own Adventure&trade; books, so I dug up some links.  The [~~Choose Your Own Adventure~~](http://www.choose-your-own-adventure.com/) website bears no obvious connection to the books; it's closer in spirit to [~~Blog Your Own Adventure~~](http://www.blogyourownadventure.com/).  [Google Answers](http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=385733) says the trademark is registered but dead, and recommends hiring a lawyer if you need to know what that means.

Wikipedia has a [list of titles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure) from the original series and an informative article on the genre of [interactive fiction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction) (IF). 

### Update

The domain ~~choose-your-own-adventure.com~~ is now unclaimed (as is ~~chooseyourownadventure.com~~); also Blog Your Own Adventure seems to be broken.

The Wikipedia article on [gamebooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamebook) is more relevant than the one linked above.
