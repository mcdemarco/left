Via a mailing list:  [Time magazine](http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,1873122,00.html) contemplates the vanity press, readership numbers, fan fiction, and the future of publishing.

> A lot of headlines and blogs to the contrary, publishing isn't dying. But it is evolving, and so radically that we may hardly recognize it when it's done. <!--break--> Literature interprets the world, but it's also shaped by that world, and we're living through one of the greatest economic and technological transformations since--well, since the early 18th century. The novel won't stay the same: it has always been exquisitely sensitive to newness, hence the name. It's about to renew itself again, into something cheaper, wilder, trashier, more democratic and more deliriously fertile than ever.
