Via [GeekPress](http://www.geekpress.com/2007/04/for-first-time-astronomers-have.html):   the Associated Press reports on the [discovery of a potentially habitable extrasolar planet](http://apnews.myway.com/article/20070424/D8ON8OSG0.html).

> The planet was discovered by the European Southern Observatory's telescope in La Silla, Chile, which has a special instrument that splits light to find wobbles in different wave lengths. Those wobbles can reveal the existence of other worlds.<!--break-->
>
> What they revealed is a planet circling the red dwarf star, Gliese 581. Red dwarfs are low-energy, tiny stars that give off dim red light and last longer than stars like our sun. Until a few years ago, astronomers didn't consider these stars as possible hosts of planets that might sustain life.
>
> The discovery of the new planet, named 581 c, is sure to fuel studies of planets circling similar dim stars. About 80 percent of the stars near Earth are red dwarfs.
