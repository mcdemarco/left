[Technovelgy speculates](http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/Science-Fiction-News.asp?NewsNum=1892) on time-traveling tinkerers as a possible cause of the Large Hadron Collider's recent malfunction.  Somehow or other [our imminent death by planet-sucking black hole](http://hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com/) has been postponed until the spring, leaving us all plenty of time to do those last-minute things that a species should do before meeting its Maker.<!--break-->

A while back I found a writing prompt on this topic:  ["The world will end in one week.  What will you do until then?"](http://jc-schools.net/write/create.htm)  My little story involved playing Cassandra, like the folks at [LHC Facts](http://www.lhcfacts.org/), though I was only trying to convince people to help me party like it was 1999.  So my writing prompt for the day is:  **The world will end in six months when the LHC finally creates that planet-sucking black hole.  What will you do until then?**
