I have one image so far in my [gallery at Ashundar](http://www.terragen.org/gallery/index.php?cat=12123).  I read a few tutorials for making planets with [Terragen](http://planetside.co.uk/terragen/), but still had to figure out several things on my own in order to generate the picture.  I'm hoping to write my own planet tutorial before I forget what I did.

I found Terragen back when I was looking for mapping software like [Grass](/node/11).  You can feed a real elevation map into Terragen as well, but the focus is more on art than accuracy.
