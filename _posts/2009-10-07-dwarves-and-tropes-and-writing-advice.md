I was browsing the Writers of the Future blog for this quarter's results (more Honorable mentions are up, but no finalists yet) and I came across some old contest advice:  [K.D. Wentworth's top-five list of what not to do](http://wotfblog.blogspot.com/2007/07/top-five-disqualification-points-during.html) when entering the WotF contest.  To summarize:  grammatical errors, bad spelling, withholding information, tropes, and infodumps are bad; showing the sf/f content early on is good.<!--break-->

I did disagree with part of one point:  I don't think dwarves (or trolls) are an overused trope yet.  It's quite difficult to find novels specifically about them (as opposed to all the other tropes on the list).  I recently bought and read *The Dwarves* by Markus Heitz, but this is a translation of a German novel.  Other than that, there is a long out-of-print Dragonlance trilogy, a Choose Your Own Adventure-style book from the eighties, [an obscure mainstream novel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dwarf) by a Swedish Nobel laureate, and [a self-published series](http://daadams.com/the-brotherhood-of-dwarves-series/) about dwarves.  I doubt the short-story market is any more dwarf-heavy.
