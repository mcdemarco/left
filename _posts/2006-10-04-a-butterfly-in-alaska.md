Via [GeekPress](http://www.geekpress.com/2006/10/storm-swells-in-alaska-caused-breakup.html):  LiveScience reports that [a storm in Alaska](http://www.livescience.com/forcesofnature/061002_iceberg_wave.html) broke up an iceberg off Antarctica.

> On a calm, clear day in October 2005, a huge Antarctic iceberg broke into half a dozen pieces. Today, scientists said the event was triggered by ocean swells kicked up during an Alaskan stormâ€”half a world away.
> 
> At 60 miles long and 18.5 miles wide, the iceberg called B15A was half of a larger iceberg called B15, which was for a time the world's largest iceberg after breaking away from the Antarctic's in Ross Ice Shelf in 2000.
