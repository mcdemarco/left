 Refilling toner cartridges is a useful skill for the professional writer.  JWR ran a [toner tips](http://www.jewishworldreview.com/0804/toner_tips.asp) article today.  Who would have guessed that new printers came with half-empty toner cartridges?  That must be why mine ran low on ink after only 500 pages.  At least it was free (after the rebate).
