 [Jim Henry](http://www.mindspring.com/~jimhenry/conlang.htm) did a [write-up](http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0409b&L=conlang&F=&S=&P=7236) on the conlang (constructed language) meetings at Noreascon for the [conlang list](http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A0=conlang).  I was at the "One Language to Rule Them All" panel by Tim Smith and the confab afterwards.  Since then I've found a few helpful conlanging sites, most notably [Langmaker](http://www.langmaker.com/), with its [advice to the new conlanger](http://www.langmaker.com/ml00.htm) and a favorite [conlanging flag](http://www.langmaker.com/db/log_0409.htm#FlagDaze).
