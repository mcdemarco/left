The latest convention to appear online in response to the coronavirus pandemic is [reCONvene 2020](https://reconvenesff.com), a one-day event happening tomorrow.  This one isn't free, but I can't really call $10 expensive after having attended some WorldCons.  Besides an assortment of panels, there will also be online gaming.
