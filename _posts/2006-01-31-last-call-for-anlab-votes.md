[Michael Burstein](http://mabfan.com/) reminded me that Analog's annual [Analytical Laboratory poll](http://www.analogsf.com/analogreaders_2005.shtml) closes today or tomorrow (depending on whether you believe the print version or the web ballot).  I'm not quite finished with my 2005 Analogs, but I've gathered them all from their scattered piles and I'm hoping to figure out which story was which in time for the deadline.
