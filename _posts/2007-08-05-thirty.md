Mark Liberman at [Language Log](http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004787.html) meets *thirty* for the first time, and restricts it too narrowly to newspapers although the earliest citations don't mention them:

> **1895** *Funk's Standard Dict.*, Thirty..among printers and telegraphers, the last sheet, word, or line of copy or of a despatch; the last; the end. <!--break-->
> **1929** *Amer. Speech IV.* 290 ‘30’ or ‘Thirty’ indicates the end of a shift or of the day's work, and has come to mean, also, death.

The XXX theory of thirty seems the most likely, for its similarity to ###.
