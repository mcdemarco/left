Interactive fiction came up briefly at the panel about online fiction markets at Readercon today.  The one title mentioned was [253 by Geoff Ryman](http://www.ryman-novel.com/).  With the help of someone else's [tweet](http://twitter.com/jmcdaid/status/2599572395) about it, I looked it up once I got home.  While certainly non-linear, it turned out to be less interactive than I expected.  (This is not a Choose Your Own Adventure story.)

On the other hand, there's an interesting [drabble](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drabble) aspect to the story, with each page being exactly 253 words long.<!--break-->
