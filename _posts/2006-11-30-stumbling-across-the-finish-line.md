Another year, another novel:

![NaNoWriMo 2006 winner](http://www.mcdemarco.net/files/pictures/nano_2006_winner_large.gif)

Those who don't quite grok the National Novel Writing Month concept tend to ask what I'm doing with my novel now that it's done---submitting it, or entering it in a contest, or getting back some unspecified *results* from NaNoWriMo.  It's surprising difficult to convey the notion that the outcome of writing 50,000 words in one month is no more or less than...50,000 words.<!--break-->

*No less* is one of the NaNoWriMo rules, so it's *no more* that wants explaining.  First of all, this year I wrote a fantasy, and 50,000 words is barely past the prologue in fantasy terms, so I am not done.  Secondly, high-speed NaNoWriMo writing is not quite quality prose, so if the novel were done it would need some heavy editing before I'd show it to anyone.  Thirdly, I'm a short-story writer, so even if the plot had gotten past Act II and the writing past See Thorin Run, I still wouldn't have anything resembling a novel.

So why do I do this every year?  I've come to the conclusion that NaNoWriMo is a world-building exercise for me more than anything else.  The world and culture of my novel's main characters now have a depth I hardly dreamed of at the start of November:  a thousand years of history accounted for, a map of the continent, a disintegrating economic system, a global environmental disaster in progress, a minor migration, a calendar, a kinship system, a sketchy guild setup, funeral rites, pieces of a conlang, an architecture, unexpected steampunk technology, etc.  Most of them are things I would not have thought of without the desperate need to write 2,000 words *right now* about *something*.
