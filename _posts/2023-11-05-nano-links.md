I owe yesterday's [cookbook cat vacuuming](/blog/023/11/04/quick-indexed/) to the [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org/) season.  I haven't been nanoing regularly for a while, though I have used the last couple of seasons to work on my Twine story format [PrePub](/tools/scree/prepub/) (for converting Twine stories to print-like formats), as well as a better Emacs mode for Twee.  My "novels" have been test stories that never get very far.  This year I'm working on a fixed format gamebook inspired by a clever French series, which should be an interesting exercise in the conversion of Twine to print.

One sign of the season I can never resist is [the NaNoWriMo forums](https://forums.nanowrimo.org), with a side of [the real Scrivener forums](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com).  NaNo *qua* trainwreck did not disappoint, opening up with a ritual apology from a long-time moderator; despite her absence posts are still moving around from place to place and disorienting people.  I myself had trouble finding the [Worldbuilding category](https://forums.nanowrimo.org/c/story-development/worldbuilding/59) when someone suggested it as a better destination for a moved post than the [Software & Tech ghetto](https://forums.nanowrimo.org/c/helpful-resources/software-tech/65).

I don't read it for the trainwrecks, though; most of what I get out of the forums is links.  Today's winner is [VulgarLang](https://www.vulgarlang.com), a commercial conlang generator.  It does a lot of stuff, though how well is unclear at the free tier.  (Initial reviews were [pretty negative](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/9yojzd/vulgarlang/), though it may have [improved](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/171gct0/vulgarlang_and_alternatives/).)  It even outputs LaTeX dictionaries (but has you sign up for [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) to generate a PDF).  It never ceases to impress me how people (*i.e.,* developers) can make a living off of people (*i.e.,* writers) who can't make a living.  Though to be fair, Vulgarlang's market includes the far more profitable game and movie industries.

From there I found [Polyglot](https://draquet.github.io/PolyGlot/), a tool for conlanging the more traditional way (uphill both ways with a hundred words for snow), and the new location of [Gleb](https://gleb.000024.org).  Back in the day I wrote my own tool to help with my conlang, which needs more conlanging rather than more programming so I'll be sticking with non-linguistic rabbit-holes for now.
