I've been resisting creating a <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/">BoardGameGeek</a> account for some time now, but yesterday I finally broke down and <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/user/fiddly_bits">made one</a>.  So now, instead of buying me <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Language-Americas-Joseph-Greenberg/dp/0804713154">$80 linguistics books</a> off my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/3P7HPI881E84D">Amazon wishlist</a>, grateful readers can buy me <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1159-Evo">$80 board games</a> off my <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/fiddly_bits?wishlist=1&sort=wishlist&columns=thumbnail|title|status|wishlistcomment&ff=1">BGG wishlist</a>.<!--break-->

I can also play with fun widgets like this one:

<script language="javascript" src="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/jswidget.php?username=fiddly_bits&numitems=1&header=1&text=title&images=medium&show=wishlist&imagesonly=1&imagepos=center">
</script>

I picked "fiddly_bits" for a username because there was a four-letter minimum, so I couldn't use my initials.  I actually don't like games that have lots of fiddly bits.
