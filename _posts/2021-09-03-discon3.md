Though we were planning to attend [DisCon III](https://discon3.org), the somewhat-postponed 79th World Science Fiction Convention, this winter, their [new COVID policy](https://discon3.org/news/covid-policy/) is keeping us away.  So I filked about it:  [Banned from DisCon](/filk/bannedFromDisCon.html).
