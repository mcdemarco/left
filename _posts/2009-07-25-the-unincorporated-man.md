Post-[tweet](http://twitter.com/mcdemarco/status/2847299049):  I finished [*the unincorporated man*](http://www.theunincorporatedman.com/) by Dani and Eytan Kollin today.  I heard about it through the reviews on [Tor.com](http://www.tor.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=blog&id=16223) and [io9](http://io9.com/5179986/anti+corporate-libertarian-futurism-in-the-unincorporated-man).<!--break-->

The io9 review is harsher; Tor is the publisher, after all.  I also found the book uneven, especially towards the end, but it was still a great read.
