In a previous post [(now updated)](/blog/2017/10/16/my-gamebooks/), I forgot to mention the choice maps in Demian's listings, *e.g.*, [this huge flowchart](https://gamebooks.org/contributions/lifes-lottery-flowchart2.jpg) of *Life's Lottery*, until I was reminded of them by a NaNoWriMo forum post that linked to [some interesting ChooseCo maps](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/cyoa-choose-your-own-adventure-maps).  I was inspired to blog at greater length than before about choice maps.

The first choice-mappers were, of course, the authors of CYOA-style children's books in the 80's like [Jay Leibold](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/choose-your-own-adventure-cyoa-books-hand-drawn-maps), who took a flowchart-like approach.

Mark Sample [pegs the dawn of CYOA mapping online](http://www.samplereality.com/2009/11/11/a-history-of-choose-your-own-adventure-visualizations/) to September 2003, when Andrew Stern [posted](http://web.archive.org/web/20071023184056/http://grandtextauto.org/2003/09/02/choose-one-of-four-deep-paths/) a hand-written map of the recently-released [*Night of a Thousand Boyfriends*](https://gamebooks.org/Item/1138), with circled page numbers (multiple numbers in one circle in the case of non-choice links) and double-circled endings.



Directly or indirectly, Stern inspires a spate of maps of the original Choose Your Own Adventure series:  an [HTML image map](http://www.ethblue.com/cyoa/altairlarge.html) and [analysis](http://www.ethblue.com/cyoa/routes.html) of *The Third Planet from Altair*, Sample's own [curvy flowchart](http://www.samplereality.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/caveoftime1.jpg) of *The Cave of Time*, a [series of hand-drawn maps](https://gamebooks.org/User/510/Reviews) by David Sky, Sean Michael Ragan's [Graphviz map](http://www.seanmichaelragan.com/html/%5B2008-03-07%5D_Choose_Your_Own_Adventure_book_as_directed_graph.shtml) of *The Curse of Chimney Rock*, and Michael Niggel's [blocky, colorful map](http://flowingdata.com/2009/08/11/choose-your-own-adventure-most-likely-youll-die/) of *Journey Under the Sea*.

David Sky didn't restrict himself to the Choose Your Own Adventure series, and Julien Peter Benney didn't map them at all; he produced [maps of the Time Machine series](https://gamebooks.org/Series/78), some [from memory](http://jpbenney.blogspot.com/2009/02/childhood-memory-that-rmit-made-me.html).

Sample was writing in 2009, the year that [Christian Swinehart](http://samizdat.cc/cyoa/) blew all the other choicemaps out of the water.

The ChooseCo maps are a new style of choice mapping, hiding some info and simplifying some.  This is a portion of a map of a story with only 9 endings and a lot of sequences of pages (triangles) without choices (or "walls of text", as they would be called in online hyperfiction):

People who [use Graphviz](https://imgur.com/gallery/3LnDb) for choice mapping...

[DotGraph](/tools/scree/dotgraph/) generates more traditional style of choice map, with the unique look of Graphviz.
