I was trying to remember who Greg Donegan really was, and [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Mayer) led me to his real self's co-website with co-author Jennifer Crusie:  [CruiseMayer.com](http://www.crusiemayer.com/).  Besides a fun overview of their collaboration, the site has a [2007 Online Writing Workshop](http://www.crusiemayer.com/workshop/).  This month they're covering point of view.  See the [syllabus](http://www.crusiemayer.com/workshop/syllabus) for future topics.
