 I usually don't write cover letters for fiction submissions, but I ought to. I found some examples and advice from [Robert J. Sawyer](http://www.sfwriter.com/ow09.htm), [Mary Soon Lee](http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~mslee/wr.html#cover), and [PageWise](http://ct.essortment.com/coverlettersho_rtwv.htm).  For those lucky souls who experience such a dilemma, [James Van Pelt](http://www.sfwa.org/writing/sfwa.htm) discusses whether to mention that you're an SFWA member in your cover letters.
