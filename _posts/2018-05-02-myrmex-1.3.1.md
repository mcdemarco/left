[Myrmex](http://mcdemarco.github.io/myrmex/), one of my [JavaScript implementations](/games/decktet/) of solitaire games for the Decktet, suffers from an [iOS 11.3 scrolling bug](https://github.com/taye/interact.js/issues/631) that's going around all the drag-and-drop libraries.  I've done a bit of hacking around the issue for the moment and made a [beta version 1.3.1](/games/decktet/myrmex/myrmex.html) for anyone actually having issues.  (You'd know it immediately if you were.)

The reason it's only in beta is that the hack will break older browsers in the process of fixing newer ones, and there's still some hope that Apple will fix the bug on their end.
