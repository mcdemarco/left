 The rules are up for [Strange New Worlds 9](http://www.simonsays.com/content/feature.cfm?sid=44&feature_id=2850) (the ninth annual Star Trek short fiction contest run by Pocket Books), even though the results aren't out for SNW 8 yet.  I've heard that SNW 9 won't be accepting entries until the spring, but the rules don't mention that.
