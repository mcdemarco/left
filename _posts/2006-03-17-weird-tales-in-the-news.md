Via a mailing list:  The Washington Post reports on [Plato's Cream Pie and Other Horror Delicacies](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/13/AR2006031301841.html) from the latest incarnation of [Weird Tales](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weird_Tales).

> WT's April cover is a Morrill painting of a ghostly, hollow-eyed sorcerer clad in a black gown with a chain belt that holds two drooling skulls. <!--break-->  That's a gem, but it can't quite match Morrill's February cover, which showed [a buxom blonde in a tiny red dress clasped in the tentacles of a giant octopus](http://www.wildsidepress.com/product.asp?itemid=1436&catid=236) who is leering lasciviously.
