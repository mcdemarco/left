Via [Walter Jon Williams](http://walterjonwilliams.blogspot.com/2009/08/chart-of-fantasy-art.html):  Tim Holman's [survey of fantasy book cover art](http://www.timholman.net/posts/the-chart-of-fantasy-art/) shows that it's been a bad year for unicorns and dwarves.  The comments suggest some creative ways to restore balance to the Force, as it were.  <!--break--> My own idea is some refreshing [Red November](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36946) tie-in fiction.
