[Science Made Cool warns readers](http://www.sciencemadecool.com/2008/01/more-things-to.html) about the approaching killer cloud that could sterilize our corner of the galaxy in as little as 20 million years:

> What's likely to happen when it does arrive? A wave of new star formation -- lots of new, bright, massive stars forming and then blowing themselves to smithereens in supernova explosions only a few million years later. The whole region of the Milky Way Galaxy is likely to become uninhabitable as the supernovae flood it with energetic radiation.<!--break-->
>
> Really, there's nothing to do but move to the other side of the Galaxy and wait for the storm to pass. That may take some time -- the Milky Way is about 100,000 light-years across, and the central region is probably uninhabitable.
