Jon Evans at Tor.com [reviews *The Yiddish Policemen's Union*](http://www.tor.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=blog&id=15340):

> [...] I approached *The Yiddish Policemen’s Union* with a certain trepidation, despite its acclaim and fistful of awards.
>
> I needn’t have worried. [Michael] Chabon tackles not just one but damn near every genre here—alternate history, police procedural, noir thriller, fantasy—and succeeds spectacularly at them all. <!--break--> He even manages to breathe new life into the cliched corpse of the alcoholic, divorced, embittered homicide cop: our protagonist, Meyer Landsman, who is drawn into a spiralling maelstrom of trouble when a junkie neighbour at the down-at-heel hotel he calls home is found with a bullet hole in the back of his skull and an unfinished chess game on his chair, only two months before Reversion.
>
> Reversion, you ask? Well. In this alternate history, a (real-world) 1940 proposal to turn part of Alaska into a new home for the Jews became law, and the state of Israel foundered before it was founded, so millions of Jews instead fled from Europe to the boomerang-shaped island of Sitka, off the coast of Alaska, and there built a new, Yiddish-speaking city. *The Yiddish Policemen’s Union* takes place in 2007, when Sitka is due to revert to Native American control, as Hong Kong reverted to China.

I highly recommend the book.  My copy is out circulating somewhere, so you'll have to find your own.
