[PrePub](/tools/scree/prepub/) is a new Twine "proofing" format I've been working on; it's for converting a purely choice-based Twine story to a hyperlinked ePub book (with help from [pandoc](http://pandoc.org)).

Eventually I will add support (or a second format) for making a dead tree book out of the same source file, so I'm not planning to add scripting support to this process.  In fact, I've been de-scripting my Twine hyperfiction novel in order to turn it into an ePub; fortunately the scripting was minimal.
