Someone mentioned melancholy on a mailing list, meaning by it nothing distinct from *depression,* but my ear picked it up and I wondered whether melancholy was still a legitimate affliction.  (The answer appears to be no, it's been replaced by [melancholic depression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melancholic_depression).)

[Melancholy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melancholia) is Greek for *black bile,* one of the [four humours](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humorism).  (The Latin is *atra bilis*, which gives us the little-used adjective *atrabilious* but not much else.)  Even if you believe man does not [change](http://www.amazon.com/Changing-Nature-Man-Introduction-Historical/dp/039330115X), you have to admit that melancholy was formerly a humour to be kept in balance rather than a medical condition to be eradicated.  I'm a [strong Whorfian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapir-Whorf_hypothesis), so I think people who long ago believed in black bile are fundamentally different from those of us who today believe in serotonin.

So I was surprised to find myself, by a chain of wikipedia links, in the black bile camp.  The source of my reactionary physiology is, strangely enough, [the Arabic take on melancholy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melancholy#Melancholy_in_Arab_culture)---not because of any inherent difference from the classical approach, but because of its influence on those European cultures which had the closest calls with *dar al-Islam*, from which it reached its Whorfian claws into me.

Black bile is usually translated *huzn* in Arabic, but *sawda*, black, is sometimes also taken to mean *black bile* or, alternately, *love* (apparently because love was one of the common causes of black bile imbalance).  It is from *sawda* that some interesting words that no longer quite mean "black bile" allegedly spring.  For example, the Bosnian word [*sevdah*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevdah) comes from *sawda* through the Turkish, and means *love* or *longing*.  Sevdah is also the name of the national music of Bosnia.

*Fado* (fate) is the name of the national music of Portugal, but the associated word for melancholic longing is [*saudade*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudade), of uncertain etymology.  I found its hypothetical origin in *sawda* in the [Talk section of the saudade article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Saudade#hipotesis:_saudade_derive_de_s.C3.A4wd.C3.A2) and after some searching found a source for it (Castro, 1980) in this [paper on the translation of *saudade(s)*](http://linguistics.ucdavis.edu/People/pmfarrel/images-1/SaudadeFarrell.pdf).

The traditional Latin etymology of saudade is laughable even to an armchair linguist:  [Latin *solitate* with the influence of other words](http://www.priberam.pt/dlpo/definir_resultados.aspx?pal=saudade).  Said "influence" is supposed to explain the violation of all known sound laws on the way from *solitate* to *saudade*, not to mention the inexplicable semantic leap from "solitary" to "nostalgia," with a bonus change in part of speech.  That this folk etymology is itself quite old is no defense, nor is an unwillingness to admit that the most famous untranslatable word (and sentiment) in Portuguese is, in fact, Arabic in origin.  (The *-ade* ending is pure Portuguese, marking an abstract noun.)  This from a people who still say *oxalá* (*inshallah*).

The main trouble with the Arabic theory is a poor understanding of *sawda* itself:  how, when, where (besides Turkey), and why it became a synonym of *huzn* (not to mention of "love"), and how it mutated, if it did, into the uniquely Portuguese sense of "nostalgia."

Until yesterday I had my own personal folk etymology of *saudade* as being "influenced" by *saúde,* health.  *Saúde* is in fact one of the words supposed to have turned the Latin *solitate* into the Arabic *sawda*, but my thoughts were more semantic than phonetic:  *saudade* is no longer a bile imbalance or in any sense a negative or unhealthy condition in Portuguese.  It is instead a fundamental part of the national character, the feeling that launched a thousand *fados,* and the proper balance of the humours.
