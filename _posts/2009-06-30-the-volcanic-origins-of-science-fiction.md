Via a mailing list:  a somewhat vulgar Cracked story about [6 writers who accidentally produced masterpieces](http://www.cracked.com/article_17221_6-writers-who-accidentally-crapped-out-masterpieces.html) was funny but also educational.  Who knew that [the Year Without a Summer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_Without_a_Summer) kept Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin indoors long enough to [invent Frankenstein](http://www.cracked.com/article_17221_p2.html) and by extension the entire genre?
