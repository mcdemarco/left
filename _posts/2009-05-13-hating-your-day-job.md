I'm behind again on the [aggregator](/aggregator), so here's a month-old article from the Fix about the day job:

> [Jonathan Safran Foer's] premise was that challenging or meaningful jobs can suck away writersâ€™ energy and commitment to writing.  If the day job is important to the writer and emotionally satisfying, irreplaceable time and enthusiasm will go into the job, leaving less and less to the important work of writing.

### Update

The Fix is no longer in (~~http://thefix-online.com/features/what-about-the-day-job/~~).
