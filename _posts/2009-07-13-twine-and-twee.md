Via [gamebooks.org](http://www.gamebooks.org/show_links.php?type=gamebooks):  [Twine](http://twinery.org) is a free graphical gamebook editor for Windows and OS X, with a command-line version called *twee*.  It looks polished enough to save me the trouble of writing my own.

See the old Gimcrack'd page for [examples of twee-generated hypertext fiction](https://web.archive.org/web/20090716182446/http://gimcrackd.com/).

### Update

Twine now comes in two versions, and *twee* in even more.
