Via [gamebooks.org](http://www.gamebooks.org/show_links.php?type=gamebooks):  [Twine](http://gimcrackd.com/etc/src/) is a free graphical gamebook editor for Windows and OS X, with a command-line version called *twee*.  It looks polished enough to save me the trouble of writing my own.

See the main page for [examples of twee-generated hypertext fiction](http://gimcrackd.com/).
