> Twenty five elements are recognized as essential components of plants, animals and man. Because these elements are considered essential to life, they could be called "bioessential." A few others, such as cobalt and the rare earth elements, could be included, but information on their roles is less exact. Carbon (C), Nitrogen (N), Oxygen (O) and Hydrogen (H) are primarily derived from air and water and are not discussed; the other 21 elements, listed in alphabetical order, occur as minerals in the soil.
