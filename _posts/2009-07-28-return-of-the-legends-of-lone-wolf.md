[SFScope reports](http://www.sfscope.com/2009/07/john-grant-signs-deal-to-reprint-12-books-of-the-legends-of-lone-wolf/) on a deal to reprint *The Legends of Lone Wolf* series of tie-in novels for the *Lone Wolf* gamebooks:

> The gamebooks (awarded the Gamemaster International "All Time Great" award in 1991 and Game Book of the Year awards in 1985, 1986 and 1987) have been published in over 30 countries and been translated into 18 languages, and have racked up sales to date of over 10 million copies. *The Legends of Lone Wolf*, as the novels are called, didn't do (ahem) quite that well, but they were performing pretty healthily when, in the mid-1990s, the publisher pulled the plug on *Lone Wolf*ish enterprises in general in response to the overall downturn in the market for gamebooks. (This downturn affected the novels' sales as well because the publisher had been oh so cleverly marketing them into the gamebook section of bookstores, not the f/sf section.)

Some *Lone Wolf* gamebooks are available free online [at Project Aon](http://www.projectaon.org/en/Main/Home).
