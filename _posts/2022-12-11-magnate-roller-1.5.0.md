[Magnate Roller](/games/decktet/magnate/) has been brushed up to version 1.5.0.  There's a newish option to track players by name while rolling (we were getting confused) plus improved rules for solo play and other textual tweaks.  The occasion of the update was my stumbling across [a change to the solo rules](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2332690/article/33719379#33719379) on BoardGameGeek that I missed somehow back when it was posted.
