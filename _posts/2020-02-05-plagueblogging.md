I used to have another, non-writing blog: [PlagueBlog](http://plagueblog.blogspot.com/), the disease blog.  It's been moribund for a while, but it comes back out for any epidemic excitement.  I'm currently on [Day 5](http://plagueblog.blogspot.com/2020/02/day-5-in-gray-zone.html) of novel coronavirus here in Boston (and elsewhere).
