Michael Burstein notes that it's [Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Day](http://mabfan.livejournal.com/441609.html) today.  He also has a few more posts up about [the value of our work](http://mabfan.livejournal.com/tag/the+value+of+our+work): options vs. rights, and how to beg (a writer) for donations.
