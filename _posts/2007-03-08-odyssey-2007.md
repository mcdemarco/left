The application deadline is April 13.  More information is available at <http://www.odysseyworkshop.org>.

It's hard to believe I was at Odyssey way back in 2004.  Thanks largely to the workshop, I've joined the 50% of published graduates since then.  It's entirely my own fault that I still haven't written that Great American Science Fantasy Novel.
