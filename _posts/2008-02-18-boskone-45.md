I stopped by [Boskone 45](http://www.nesfa.org/Boskone/) on Sunday and saw some folks and some panels.  There was no premature desperate flight from an approaching blizzard this year, yet the con looked small in that big space (the Westin Waterfront, and by extension the waterfront itself, which retains its essential concrete desertness despite all the new development).

Apparently Charlie Stross is still in town; he'll be at Pandemonium [tomorrow night](http://community.livejournal.com/pandemonium_bks/160051.html).
