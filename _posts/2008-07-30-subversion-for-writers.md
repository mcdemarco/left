Via [I Should Be Writing](http://web.archive.org/web/20091013082557/http://isbw.murlafferty.com/2008/07/20/isbw-94-truths/):  Rachel Greenham has a writeup on [subversion for writers](http://web.archive.org/web/20100907042051/http://strangenoises.org/subversion-for-writers/).  I find rcs more than sufficient for my version control needs, but I suppose subversion could help other writers get in a few good hours of [cat-vacuuming](http://web.archive.org/web/20120306192302/http://www.cvswriters.com/).
