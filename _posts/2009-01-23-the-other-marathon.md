Via [Universal Hub](http://www.universalhub.com/node/22894):  derspatchel posts [mini-reviews](http://derspatchel.livejournal.com/688316.html) of all the movies scheduled for this year's [Sci-Fi Marathon](http://bostonscifi.com/) at the Somerville Theater, the thing people do instead of (or after) [Boskone](http://www.nesfa.org/Boskone/).  The 34th annual marathon will be happening on President's Day weekend, February 15th and 16th.
