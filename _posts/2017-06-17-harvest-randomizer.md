I didn't support the [Kingdom Builder: Harvest](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/195267/kingdom-builder-harvest) kickstarter and I haven't gotten a copy yet, but back when I [added Marshlands](/blog/2016/10/05/marshlands-randomizer/) to my [Kingdom Builder randomizer](/games/kb/randomizer.html) I also promised to eventually update it for Harvest,.  The actual changes would have been simple if I weren't so horrified by the spaghetti code into which the randomizer had grown over the years.

It's a little late for refactoring when Harvest is the last expected expansion in the [tumultuous history](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1681644/looks-no-delivery-until-march-queen-update) of Kingdom Builder, but refactor I did.  This cleared up some subtle bugs and introduced some less-subtle bugs, all of which are, hopefully, squashed now.  Please let me know if they're still crawling around in there.

The source is still [at github](https://github.com/mcdemarco/kingdom-builder-randomizer).
