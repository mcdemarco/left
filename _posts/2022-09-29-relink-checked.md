The old link blog continues to [link rot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot), but I've cleaned up most of the other links except for some tough jobs like [The Accidental Conlanger](/conlang/) and the [hyperfiction software list](/tools/hyperfic/software.html).  Things that *did* get a thorough treatment include [the Chesterton pages](/gkc/) and [my cookbook](/recipes/).

Perhaps the most impressive failure to redirect this time was LightLife's brilliant idea of moving the entire `/products/` directory to a `/product/` directory, with no redirection.
