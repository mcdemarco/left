The [fourth-quarter winners](http://wotfblog.galaxypress.com/2007/02/winners-announced-for-4th-qtr-writers.html) of the Writers of the Future contest bring the [table of contents](http://wotfblog.galaxypress.com/2007/01/winners-for-writers-of-future-xxiii.html) to a close, except possibly for some published finalists.  [Robert Sawyer](http://sfwriter.com/2007/02/writers-of-future-winners.html) has rave reviews for one of the stories:

> This quarter had fabulously good stories, but I'll say here right now that Andrea Kail's "The Sun God at Dawn, Rising from a Lotus Blossom" is a total knockout --- this is a Hugo-caliber story, folks. It'll be worth the cost of the anthology (which will be published in August) all by itself.<!--break-->
