I don't update the [recipes](/recipes/) from [Github](https://github.com/mcdemarco/the-new-kitchen-cookbook/) to the site frequently, but after making [Rough Puff](/recipes/pie/roughPuff/) pastry for [Feta Puffs](/recipes/pie/fetaPuffs/) for a party that got snowed out, I used my unexpected free time to go through the partially-manual update process.  I didn't take pictures of the puff pieces, but I only made half the batch and we only ate a quarter of it, so there's still hope.  (Other recent, mostly unphotographed recipes include [Devilled Chicken Thighs](/recipes/poultry/devilledChicken/), [Turkey or Chicken a la King](/recipes/poultry/turkeyChickenKing/), and [M&M Bark](/recipes/cookies/mnmBark/).)

While I was under the Jekyll hood, I automated more of the process so that now there's only one manual step: fitting new recipes into the human-curated recipe list order.  The menus have been rearranged and renamed a bit as well.  The recipes, the accidental conlanger, and the material formerly classified under "social" or "stream" now appear together under the heading "[salmi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmagundi)".
