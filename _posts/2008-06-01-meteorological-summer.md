Today is the start of [meteorological summer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season#Meteorological), the hottest quarter of the northern year which incidentally runs from June 1st to August 31st.  Of all the definitions for the seasons (see [Durin's Autumn](/node/417) for details), the meteorological one seems to fit the weather best.  So happy summer!
