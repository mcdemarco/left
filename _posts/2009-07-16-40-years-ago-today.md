[SFScope](http://sfscope.com/2009/07/40-years-ago-men-walked-on-the/) has links about the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11, along with a mock-interview with Michael Collins.

> Usually, you find yourself either too young or too old to do what you really want, but consider: Neil Armstrong was born in 1930, Buzz Aldrin 1930, and Mike Collins 1930. We came along at exactly the right time. We survived hazardous careers and we were successful in them. But in my own case at least, it was 10 percent shrewd planning and 90 percent blind luck. Put "lucky" on my tombstone.

There are also a couple of [Twitter reenactments](http://twitter.com/mcdemarco/status/2672067214) of the landing going on.
