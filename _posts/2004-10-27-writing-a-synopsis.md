 I need to write a novel synopsis or two, so I googled for advice.  Pat McCutcheon has a book about it, [Writing the Fiction Synopsis: A Step by Step Approach ](http://www.gryphonbooksforwriters.com/WTFS.htm), but I don't think I need quite that much advice. 

Crawford Kilian's [Advice on Novel Writing](http://www.steampunk.com/sfch/writing/ckilian/#7) has a synopsis section that covers the basics.  Bill Johnson has an essay about [Writing a Story Synopsis](http://www.storyispromise.com/wsynop.htm) which focuses on getting your theme into a one-page synopsis.

WriteCraft's [Synopsis Secrets](http://www.writecraftweb.com/articles/wcSynopsisSecret.html) involve a long list of don'ts (in the sidebar). [Pagewise](http://il.essortment.com/synopsiswriteb_rqmx.htm) has a list of do's.

Sometime's it's easiest to learn by example.  Charlotte Dillon provides [a sample synopsis](http://www.geocities.com/charlottedillon2000/synopsis.html).

My overall favorite is Beth Anderson's [Barebones Synopsis Page](http://www.geocities.com/hotclue/barebones.html), which gives a step-by-step, synopsis-by-synopsis approach.
