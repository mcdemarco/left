I've been playing my JavaScript implementation of the Decktet solitaire game [Myrmex](http://mcdemarco.github.io/myrmex/) a lot lately and noticed some annoying clickthrough bugs of uncertain age and origin, which are now fixed.  Once again, if you need an older version of Myrmex hosted somewhere, let me know and I'll put one up.  You can also download it [from GitHub](https://github.com/mcdemarco/myrmex) and open up the web page---no building or web-serving required.
