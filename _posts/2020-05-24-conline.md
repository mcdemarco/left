Several conventions have gone online in response to the coronavirus.  [Virtual Balticon 54](https://www.balticon.org/wp54/) is going on this weekend, with all-free content.  (You need to register for most panels and events individually through zoom.)

Next weekend [Narrascope 2020](http://narrascope.org) is going online, also for free.  Registration is optional; the content will be streamed.  Most of the Thursday workshops are already booked up, but the con runs Thursday to Thursday, so there's plenty more content to be had.
