I've finished pressing the "migrate my repository from Mercurial on Bitbucket to Git on GitHub" [button](https://github.com/new/import); my repositories are now safe from [the circular bitbucket](/blog/2020/05/10/circular-bitbucket/).  I've [punted a bit](https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Bitbucket-articles/What-to-do-with-your-Mercurial-repos-when-Bitbucket-sunsets/ba-p/1155380/page/19#M776) on the issue of migrating my issues, and still have plenty of links to update but I will sigh a sigh of relief anyway.
