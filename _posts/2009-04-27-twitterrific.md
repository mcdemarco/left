I signed up for twitter in order to follow the flu epidemic, but it's proving addictive on other fronts as well.  My feed is at [twitter.com/mcdemarco/](http://twitter.com/mcdemarco/).  <!--break--> Everything I know about twitter I learned from [this Twitter FAQ](http://www.brentozar.com/archive/2008/08/twitter-101/).  My current client is [Twitterrific](http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific).
