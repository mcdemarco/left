I couldn't help checking out the [Metafilter post](http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/40223) behind the title "who'd bother naming something as shortlived as a cat?"  The comments led me to [Futurese:
The American Language in 3000 AD](http://www.xibalba.demon.co.uk/jbr/futurese.html), a linguistic extrapolation by Justin B. Rye.  He gives plenty of helpful background information on phonetic change.  If you're just curious about how English might sound in another thousand years, skip ahead to the [examples](http://www.xibalba.demon.co.uk/jbr/futurese.html#s9).
