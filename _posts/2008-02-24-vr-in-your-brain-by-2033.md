I found [this prediction](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7258105.stm) accidentally, through a disease search for [my other blog](http://plagueblog.blogspot.com/) that picked up on an odd statement about Parkinson's.  (I have no idea what the "pea-sized computer" refers to, unless it's some sort of misunderstanding of Deep Brain Stimulation.)  In any event, your friendly futurist Ray Kurzweil predicts that the successor to this mythical pea will be in-brain VR:

> He said a billion-fold increase in computing performance and capability over the next 25 years coupled with the 100,000 fold shrinking, would lead to "blood cell-size devices... that can go inside our bodies and keep us healthy and inside our brain and expand our intelligence".
>
> He said the blood cell computers would be able to "produce full immersion virtual reality from inside the nervous system".
