Since I haven't had time to provide content lately, I've decided to add a category for quotations about writing.  I'll open with an anti-procrastination quote from Goethe:

> Each indecision brings its own delays and days are lost lamenting over lost days . . . What you can do or think you can do, begin it. For boldness has magic, power, and genius in it.  _Johann Wolfgang von Goethe_
