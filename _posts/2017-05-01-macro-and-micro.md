I backed the [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/) Kickstarter mainly in memory of App.net, since I wasn't sure whether anything would come of it---mostly because of the odd choice to make the Kickstarter about a book rather than about the microblogging service that seemed to be the primary interest of the backers.  In fact, I'm still not sure anything will come of it, but invitations to Kickstarter backers are out and mine inspired me to set up an indie microblog.

The new smallness can be found under [micro](/blog/micro/), or (hopefully soon) at Micro.blog under [my username](https://micro.blog/mcdemarco).  I also tossed in [the feed](https://pnut.io/mcdemarco) from pnut.io, my preferred less indie but more convenient microblogging successor to App.net.
