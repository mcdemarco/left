Via [SFScope](http://sfscope.com/2008/07/missing-third-of-metropolis-re.html):  an original print of *Metropolis* has been found in Argentina. 

> Museum of Cinema Director Paula Felix-Didier said a private collector brought an original version of the film to Argentina in 1928, where it languished in the museum's archives. It was rediscovered in April,<!--break--> and the deleted scenes were combined with the known film on a DVD, which Felix-Didier brought to the Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau Foundation in Germany in June. The Foundation, which owns the rights to *Metropolis*, confirmed the scenes were original. Felix-Didier said "The film hasn't left the museum and it won't leave until the city government and the Murnau Foundation decide what to do."
>
> Director Helmut Possman of the Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau Foundation said the uncut film, which is badly scratched, would be made available to the public after it had been restored.

I wonder how they confirmed that the missing scenes were original.  Do they have a witness?
