I saw on [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/03/15/1845250) that Google was giving away GMail accounts to random people who visit the [Google home page](http://www.google.com/).  I tried it and won the invite lottery.  Now I have the obvious gmail.com address (mcdemarco), which I plan to use as a replacement for my somewhat unstable domain email.
