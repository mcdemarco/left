Via [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamebooks/comments/qap8mj/the_rise_fall_rise_of_choose_your_own_adventure/):  YouTube channel Toy Galaxy gives a brief history of Choosing Your Own Adventure titled [The Rise & Fall & Rise of Choose Your Own Adventure Books](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-f5YelgmMs).  New to me were the DVD and Audible/Alexa version, some details of the merger-driven corporate abandonment of the series, the weakness of ChooseCo's trademark at this point, and (nevertheless) the settlement of the Netflix trademark lawsuit.  The only howler in there was his calling Lone Wolf a "copycat" book.

If you prefer an unpunctuated transcript, you can [read one here](https://youtubetranscript.com/?v=B-f5YelgmMs), but you'll miss the excitingly retro DVD commercial.
