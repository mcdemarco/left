 Here's another program I found while browsing the NaNoWriMo forums: [AutoREALM: The Free GNU Mapper](http://autorealm.sourceforge.net/features.html).  Don't let the GNU mislead you; AutoREALM is available only for Windows. It's intended for gamers, but if you're addicted to [maps](http://autorealm.sourceforge.net/mapsLPG.html) AutoREALM may be for you.
