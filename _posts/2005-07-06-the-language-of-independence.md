You can read about my fourth of July [elsewhere](http://www.livejournal.com/users/mabfan/139060.html).  I didn't have any deep political thoughts about the reading of the Declaration of Independence; my deep thought was that _unalienable_ is not a word.

Apparently, [unalienable vs. inalienable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence#Inalienable_vs._unalienable) is still a matter of controversy, or at least confusion.  Some blame [John Adams](http://oll.libertyfund.org/Texts/Becker0298/DeclOfIndependence/HTMLs/0034Sections/LeeCopy.html#LF-BK0034pt01ch04_ftn46), but others say [the printer acted alone](http://www.class.uh.edu/comm/comm_law/creating_nation/constitutionalconvention.html).      Some chalk _unalienable_ up to the [lax spelling standards of the time](http://www.geocities.com/Athens/7842/jbconv11.htm), while others claim that [unalienable has an archaic meaning all its own](http://www.cia.gov/csi/kent_csi/docs/v20i3a01p_0002.htm).  And some say these problems could be cleared up if the Declaration were [translated into modern English](http://www.bartleby.com/185/a1.html).
