Via [GeekPress](http://www.geekpress.com/2005_03_02_daily.html):  National Geographic reports on our national [sleep debt](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/02/0224_050224_sleep.html): 

> Sleep deprivation has a very negative impact on cognitive abilities, creativity, and alertness. It has been shown to adversely affect language skills, decision-making, and memory.

("Sleep deprivation" refers to anything less than 7 or 8 hours a night.)  I don't mind the loss of alertness, memory, or decision-making skills, but the article made me worry that my growing sleep debt is cutting into my creativity.  Less time spent in bed also means 1/3 less opportunity for the three B's of inspiration (the bed, the bath, and the bus).

On the other hand, I know people who swear by the less-is-more approach to sleep.  Writers are expected to burn the midnight oil--especially those of us without much else to burn.
