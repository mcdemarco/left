I saw on [MetaFilter](http://ask.metafilter.com/58540/Forgotten-title-of-amazing-online-scifi-story) that Ted Chiang has a [novella coming out from Subterranean Press](http://subterraneanpress.com/index.php/2007/02/21/ted-chiang-announcing-the-merchant-and-the-alchemists-gate/):

> In medieval Baghdad, a penniless man is brought before the most powerful man in the world, the caliph himself, to tell his story. It begins with a walk in the bazaar, but soon grows into a tale unlike any other told in the caliph’s empire. It’s a story that includes not just buried treasure and a band of thieves, but also men haunted by their past and others trapped by their future; it includes not just a beloved wife and a veiled seductress, but also long journeys taken by caravan and even longer ones taken with a single step. Above all, it’s a story about recognizing the will of Allah and accepting it, no matter what form it takes.
