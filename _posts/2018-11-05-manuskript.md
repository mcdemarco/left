I'm using Scrivener 3 with Scree this NaNoWriMo (and yes, I'm behind already), but I've always dreamed of a Scrivener with a plain-text backend.  There are ways to work around Scrivener's RTF file format, and it has features I can't give up (yet), but I'm still taking a longing look at [Manuskript](http://www.theologeek.ch/manuskript/), a Linux-first open source Scrivener-style editor that uses a plain-text file format.
