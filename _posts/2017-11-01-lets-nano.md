Gentlemen, start your novels!

I usually start the [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org/) month at midnight, but last night I decided to read a bit instead and start fresh in the morning.  Now I'm trying to remember my Scrivener shortcuts, since I've only been editing my hyperfiction stories lately, not starting a fresh one where I need to command-K frequently.

Since I work in plain text, I disabled the ruler shortcuts (command-R and shift-command-R) by overwriting them with shortcuts to some no-op commands (Bring All to Front and Arrange in Front), under System Preferences | Keyboard.  I still needed to swap around Paste and Match Style with Paste to keep it *looking* like plain text, since Scrivener's underlying format is actually RTF.
