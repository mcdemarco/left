Via [John Scalzi](http://whatever.scalzi.com/?s=metatropolis):  the audio anthology of the ecopocalypse, [METAtropolis](http://whatever.scalzi.com/2009/01/09/metatropolis-reviews-award-pimp-addendum/), is [coming out in hardcover](http://whatever.scalzi.com/2009/01/09/the-printed-metatropolis/) this August from Subterranean Press.

> I’m really excited to have this version of Metatropolis coming up, because while I’m obviously biased, I think the anthology well and truly *rocks*, and I’m happy it’ll be available in both print and audio.<!--break--> Also, having seen the layout and design of the printed version, I can tell you that this is one *pretty* book. You’re going to want to hold and pet it and give it a special name. Trust me on this one.

If you're not sure you want to hug it and squeeze it and call it George, there's apparently still a [free download](http://whatever.scalzi.com/2008/10/17/your-weekend-goodie-free-metatropolis-story/) of one of the stories available from [Audible](http://www.audible.com/adbl/entry/offers/productPromo2.jsp?BV_UseBVCookie=Yes&productID=FR_ADBL_000570) (registration required).
