Metafilter has a thread about what [science fiction books a literature fan would enjoy](http://ask.metafilter.com/mefi/37305).  _Cloud Atlas_, _Dhalgren_, and _Galatea 2.2_ caught my eye as books I should read.  If you're in a rush, skip ahead to the [list of (most) books recommended in the thread](http://ask.metafilter.com/mefi/37305#580285).
