Via [GeekPress](http://www.geekpress.com/2006/09/worlds-first-hypoallergenic-cats-are.html):  the BBC reports that [Allerca](http://www.allerca.com/) is [now selling hypoallergenic cats](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/5375900.stm).

> The company says the animals will not cause the red eyes, sneezing and even asthma triggered by cat allergy, except in the most acute cases.
> 
> Despite costing $3,950 (Â£2,104), there is already a waiting list to get one.
> 
> Allerca first started taking orders for hypoallergenic cats back in 2004.

Allerca used its biotech for eugenic rather than genetic modification:

> It tested huge numbers of cats trying to find the tiny fraction that do not carry the glycoprotein Fel d1 - contained in an animal's saliva, fur and skin - which often prompts an allergic reaction in humans.
> 
> Those cats were then selectively bred to produce the hypoallergenic kittens now on sale, the company says.
