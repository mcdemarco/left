For my new month's resolution I'm writing flash fiction.  I started reading and writing some short-shorts after NaNoWriMo, but then fell off the wagon.  Now I'm back on again and hoping that a week or two of daily flash stories on a common theme may resolve themselves into something longer and plottier.

I'm not planning to post the results, but if you want to read some samples of the genre try [365 tomorrows](http://www.365tomorrows.com/) or [Flash Fiction Online](http://www.flashfictiononline.com/).  The latter also features some essays on writing short-short.
