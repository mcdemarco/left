I've been wondering what became of my WotF entry from last quarter, and today I think I found out.  I got an Honorable Mention certificate in the mail, along with my SASE.  This could be a stray certificate from another quarter---my name was not mentioned on the [WotF blog](http://wotfblog.galaxypress.com/) this time---but the timing suggests this quarter.
