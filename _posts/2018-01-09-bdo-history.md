Via [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/7p7td1/a_brief_history_of_the_big_dumb_object_story_in/):  Today's Big Dumb Object (BDO) story is a non-fiction recap of the genre, "[A Brief History of the Big Dumb Object Story in Science Fiction](https://www.tor.com/2018/01/08/a-brief-history-of-the-big-dumb-object-story-in-science-fiction/)" by James Davis Nicoll at Tor.  He thinks "the heyday of the BDO seems to be over," because of the zeitgeist or the stock plots---I would say it's the difficulty of fitting a human-sized story to an inhuman-sized setting---and he laments the lack of women writing BDO stories, though the commenters come up with plenty of recent examples, one of them even female.
