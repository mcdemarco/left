I've upped [Market Bucket](http://market-bucket.mcdemarco.net/), my App.net-based grocery list app, to version 1.2.0.  The new version lets you sort lists alphabetically or by oldest to newest (in order of creation).  The default order is still newest to oldest.  There was also a bug fix of my one known bug.

This update has been brought to you by [this weekend's ADN community hackathingy](http://blog.adnfuture.net/post/108103643385/jan-30-feb-01-communityhackday-hackweekend).  (Is it a hackathon? Is it a hackweekend? Is it a communityhackday?  Inquiring minds want to standardize our terminology...)  The weekend isn't quite over yet, but I have a Superbowl to not watch tonight while munching on Superbowl munchies and otherwise attempting to keep myself entertained at a Superbowl party.
