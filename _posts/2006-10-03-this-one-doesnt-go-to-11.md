Dean Wesley Smith [announced in his forum](http://www.deanwesleysmith.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=329) that he will not be editing _Strange New Worlds 11_, and also implied that there will be no volume 11:

> I highly doubt that there would have been a #11 anyway, what with the changes in the publishing aspects of mass market and the Star Trek program. But, of course, for ten years now, I never expected the next book to happen, and never in a million years did I expect this to go to ten volumes. So I could well be wrong again. That is up to Pocket Books.<!--break-->

> So, I'm looking forward to digging into the boxes of manuscripts one more time. Then my editing days are finished. My career and my writing has taken me away from media and into my own worlds. That's where I want to focus for the future. I may or may not make it, but it's where my interest is these days.
