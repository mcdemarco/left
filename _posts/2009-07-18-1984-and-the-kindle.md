Via [io9](http://io9.com/5317703/amazon-secretly-removes-1984-from-the-kindle): in a stunning fit of irony, Amazon secretly deleted all copies of *1984* from all Kindles.

> An uproar followed, with outraged customers pointing out the irony that Amazon was deleting copies of a novel about a fascist media state that constantly alters history by changing digital records of what has happened.
