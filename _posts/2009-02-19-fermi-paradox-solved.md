I posted this to a mailing list yesterday, but then forgot to blog it last night.  Via [Futurismic](http://futurismic.com/2009/02/02/fermi-paradox-solved/):  the physics arXiv blog [reports](http://arxivblog.com/?p=1167) on a possible solution to Fermi's Paradox.<!--break-->

> [...] the famous Drake equation, which attempts put a figure on the
number intelligent civilisations out there now, implies that if the
number of intelligent civilisations capable of communication in our
galaxy is greater than 1, then we should eventually hear from them.

> That overlooks one small factor, says Reginald Smith from the
Bouchet-Franklin Institute in Rochester, New York state. He says that
there is a limit to how far a signal from ET can travel before it
becomes too faint to hear. And when you factor that in, everything
changes."
