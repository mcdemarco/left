Via a mailing list:  I will just note in passing that the once-reputable romance publishing giant Harlequin Enterprises has become a vanity press, as noted by the [RWA](http://www.rwanational.org/).  Jackie Kessler has [a detailed exegesis](http://www.jackiekessler.com/blog/2009/11/19/harlequin-horizons-versus-rwa/) of Harlequin's press release announcing their new vanity imprint.
