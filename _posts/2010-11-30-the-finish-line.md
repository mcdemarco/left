I hesitate to call it a novel, but I have limped over the finish line with about 50,100 words.  In NaNoWriMo terms I think I blew a knee this time.  I did not hit my all-time high daily word count (8,000 or so, I think) but I did do a couple of days of 6,666 words at the last minute.  Maybe next year I'll pace myself better.<!--break-->
