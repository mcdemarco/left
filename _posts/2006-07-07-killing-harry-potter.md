Via a mailing list:  [the Daily Mail reports](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=392634&in_page_id=1773) that J. K. Rowling may kill off Harry Potter.

> Asked why she would not commit herself to saying exactly whether or not she was going to kill him, she added: 'I'm not going to commit myself because I don't want the hate mail!'

The article is full of fun quotes:

> While one character will now get a reprieve, "two die that I didn't intend to die".   Asked by Judy if it will be any of the much loved characters, she said: "A price has to be paid, we are dealing with pure evil here. They don't target extras do they? They go for the main characters...<!--break-->well I do. This is a world where some pretty nasty things can happen."

About life after Harry, she says:

> But she admits she finds it unlikely she will ever be as popular again. "I don't think I'm going to get another Harry again, it only happens once."
