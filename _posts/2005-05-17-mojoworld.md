I've been playing with more mapping and rendering software lately.  Today I downloaded a demo of [MojoWorld 3](http://www.pandromeda.com/products/mojoworldstandard.php), largely because of their gorgeous [on-site gallery](http://www.pandromeda.com/gallery/still_thumbnails.php) of alien worlds.  I think it would be a fun writing exercise to pick a still image out of the gallery and write a short-short story about it.
