I've been reading *Aftershock & Others: 19 Oddities* by F. Paul Wilson.  I'm enjoying the short stories, especially "Offshore", but the unique part of the anthology is the description of his career scattered between the stories, and especially his largely unsuccessful attempts to sell interactive fiction back in the 1990's.<!--break-->

I tweeted a couple of hyperfiction links as well:  [The Google Adventure](http://blogoscoped.com/googleadventure/) and [100 Flash Fiction Hypertexts](http://susangibb.net/blog2/my-work/one-hundred-stories-project/).
