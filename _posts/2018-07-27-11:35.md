While contemplating my forthcoming updates to [PrePub](/tools/scree/prepub/) and how I would make a dead-tree version of an e-gamebook, I found an old [LaTeX gamebook package](https://ctan.org/pkg/gamebook?lang=en).  It doesn't actually do that much, but then there's not much to do and it's always handy when someone else has already done it for you.
