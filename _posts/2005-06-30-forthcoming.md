I finally got around to putting the Amazon link to [Strange New Worlds 8](http://www.psiphi.org/cgi/upc-db/1416503455.html) in the left-hand column, just in time for the July release date.

I added a new Drupal block and stuck in the iframe code from Amazon, wrapped in a centered div.  I was pleased to see that Amazon has more formatting options for associate links than the last time I looked, so I was able to take off the black border and the price ($10.17, if you're dying to know---$14.95 retail).  I also added the name of my story.

If you want to see a legible version the cover, there's a huge one (2MB) up at [SimonSays.com](http://www.simonsays.com/content/content.cfm?sid=449&pid=508727&agid=27).  I have a [smaller larger version](/images/snw8-med.png) that's only 300k.
