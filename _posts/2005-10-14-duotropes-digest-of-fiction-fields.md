Here's another handy link I found on a mailing list:  [Duotrope's Digest of Fiction Fields](http://www.duotrope.com/digest/index.aspx).

> Use this page to search for fiction markets that may make a fine home for that short story or poem you just finished. We check all the listings at least once a week and update accordingly.
