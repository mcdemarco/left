Boskone, New England's longest-running science fiction and fantasy convention, begins in a week and a half.  February 14--16 will be a fun weekend filled with discussions of books, science, art, games, music, and more. Visit the [Boskone website](http://www.boskone.org/), the [schedule](https://schedule.boskone.org/), the [Boskone Blog](https://boskoneblog.com/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/boskonenews), or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/boskone/) for more details!

I'm [on the schedule](https://schedule.boskone.org/#part/20495) again this Boskone, where I'll be talking about Star Trek and games of all sorts.
