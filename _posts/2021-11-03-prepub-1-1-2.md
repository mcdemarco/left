[PrePub](/tools/scree/prepub/), my Twine "proofing" format for converting a purely choice-based (no scripting) Twine story to a hyperlinked EPUB book (with help from [pandoc](http://pandoc.org)), is up another minor increment.  I added conversion to Pandoc/markdown from tiddlywiki formatting (the wiki style of the several non-markdown-based default story formats).  It handles some other non-Snowman idiosyncracies as well.  

The [to-do list](/tools/scree/prepub/#What.it.doesn.t.do.but.should..the.to-do.list.) is more formalized now, and besides respecting some of the special passages and tags introduced in [Gordian Book](https://gordianbook.art), there is now also [WritingFantasy](https://sophiehoulden.com/twine/writingfantasy_guide.html) to consider.

I've been using Magit lately, and this release was also intended to clean up a small Magit accident involving my master branch.  I have learned to be more careful when it asks me where I want to push to.
