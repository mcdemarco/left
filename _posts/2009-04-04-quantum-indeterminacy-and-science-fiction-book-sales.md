According to io9, science fiction book sales are [plunging](http://io9.com/5186030/how-bad-are-science-fiction-book-sales), or perhaps [slightly improving](http://io9.com/5191118/science-fiction-book-sales-went-up-as-the-economy-tanked).  We may never know the true numbers, but look on the bright side:  at least we're not in [the newspaper business](http://www.universalhub.com/node/24287).
