I was inspired by [a reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamebooks/comments/brplp8/game_book_design_software/) about gamebook software to update my list of hyperfiction tools again, this time moving it from the [old  blog post](/blog/2016/10/19/state-of-hyperfiction/) into two freestanding pages: the [thesaurus](/tools/hyperfic/) (and reading list) and the [software list](/tools/hyperfic/software.html).

The most interesting software suggestion to me was [gamebookformat](https://github.com/lifelike/gamebookformat), with its extensive handling of paragraph numbers for gamebooks.  I'm curious whether randomizing paragraph numbers will feel right to a reader who's used to manually-assembled gamebooks.  I also stumbled across some Twine vaporware called [Spiner](https://spiner.readme.io) whose goals look similar to those of my [PrePub](/tools/scree/prepub/).
