I'm still nominally planning to attend [Heliosphere](http://www.heliosphereny.org) for the first time this April, but I'm not really expecting it to still be on by then, due to plague.  (Tarrytown is near quarantined New Rochelle, NY.)   [PlagueBlog](http://plagueblog.blogspot.com/), my disease blog, is currently up to [Day 40](http://plagueblog.blogspot.com/2020/03/day-40-mens-et-manus.html) of novel coronavirus (yesterday) in Boston, at least until I write up some Day 41 news later today.
