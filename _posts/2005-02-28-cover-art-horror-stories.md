We're discussing cover art on one of my mailing lists, which reminded me of [a cover art horror story](http://withboots.blogspot.com/2005/02/adventures-in-publishing.html) I ran across recently.  I don't think I'd get that upset over a cover unless it were independently offensive---say, a naked lady or a gory corpse---but then I don't pay attention to cover art unless [the author himself drew it](http://www.xs4all.nl/~rossnbrg/homhob.gif).
