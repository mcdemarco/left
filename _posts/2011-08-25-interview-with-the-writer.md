I was interviewed virtually by Lila Munro [at Realmantic Moments yesterday](http://lilamunro.weebly.com/1/post/2011/08/welcome-mc-demarco.html).  I apologize for the late notice; I thought the interview was coming out today.  It includes an excerpt from my *Paramourtal* story, "Sympathy From the Devil."  Three or four other interviews with authors from the anthology are available under [Lila's Musings](http://lilamunro.weebly.com/lilas-musings.html).

My characters were interviewed meta-virtually by Sherry Gloag [at The Heart of Romance blog last week](http://sherrygloagtheheartofromance.blogspot.com/2011/08/mc-demarco-author-of-sympathy-from.html) while I was busy packing.  I apologize for the even later notice; I thought the interviews were coming out next month, but that turns out to be when the reviews will appear.<!--break-->  You can read more interviews of characters and their authors from the  anthology by clicking on [Sherry's *Paramourtal* label](http://sherrygloagtheheartofromance.blogspot.com/search/label/Paramourtal).
