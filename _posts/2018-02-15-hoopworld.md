Today's Big Dumb Object (BDO) is a Hoopworld or toroidal planet shaped like a doughnut.  While it's possible that such planets might form natually, they would be unstable over the long term.  [Anders Sandberg](http://www.aleph.se/andart/archives/2014/02/torusearth.html) evaluates a couple of possible toroidal planets of "natural" size (whether natural or artificially constructed)---that is, up to about six times the surface area of the Earth.

One disadvantage of the natural size is that the day length on a toroidal planet is only a few hours.  Orion's Arm [postulates](http://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/49142c044cba7) a less natural hoopworld with a more natural day length:  about 90,000 miles across, and about an Earth-sized diameter in cross-section.

To make larger hoopworlds like that, you need some artificial BDO construction and maintenance methods.  [In Episode 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrsPHPYX0TI) of Isaac Arthur's Megastructures video series, he discusses exotic construction methods for hoopworlds and suggests linking your hoopworlds together into a chain around a sun (just because you can) or putting a [topopolis](/blog/2017/09/17/topopolis/) or more hoopworlds in the middle of it.
