Last week was National Games Week, according to the [Deseret Morning News](http://deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,695229716,00.html).  (I'm not the only one who [missed it completely](http://www.nationalgamesweek.net/).)

The game is based on creating (and stealing) matching sets of cards. It's a great family game, says Casey Sartain, buyer for the store his family owns, "because it's one of the few games where you can sit a 6-year-old, a teenager and a parent at the same table and they'll be equally entertained and have an equal chance of winning."

Perhaps fewer New Yorkers have a convenient 6-year-old, teenager, and parent to play with.
