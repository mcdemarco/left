The website was in sore need of link checking; link blogs do not age well and the [link rot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot) is deep.  But I've cleaned up quite a bit of it (for the first time in a decade in [some places](/gkc/)), with a focus on non-blog content like [The Accidental Conlanger](/conlang/).  I put a fair amount of effort into keeping my own content alive (or at least propping [a tombstone](/aggregator/sources/24) up where it used to be), so it's always disappointing to see websites restructure away tons of content away altogether, or shuffle it around without putting in working redirects.

I believe the saddest loss to the Internet of geeky things is [The Darmok Dictionary](https://web.archive.org/web/20090426010545/http://rec.horus.at/trek/lists/darmok.html), which, though down for the eternal count, still persists in zombie form at the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/).  But Google does not return archival zombie texts when you search for [Shaka, when the walls fell](/conlang/sapir/shaka.html), only dead links to them.

Today we also registered for [Sasquan](http://web.archive.org/web/20201003111511/http://sasquan.org) before prices go up and Hugo nominations close---not as a [Sad](https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2015/01/21/how-you-can-aid-the-valiant-sad-puppies-3-campaign/) [Puppies](http://www.scifiwright.com/2015/01/sad-puppies-3-the-ensaddening/) thing but because we're actually going and we may as well both save the cash and rock the vote.
