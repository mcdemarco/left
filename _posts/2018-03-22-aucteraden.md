[Aucteraden](/games/decktet/aucteraden/) is yet another [JavaScript implementation](/games/decktet/) of a Decktet solitaire game, along with a scoresheet (for playing with actual cards) and an interactive rules summary.  It features offline play, undo, variants (both intentionally created by the author as well as accidentally invented by users), rule and card stats popups, and a black moons option.

Aucteraden was devised by Jack Neal; see the credits for more links.  The source code is available [at BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/mcdemarco/aucteraden).
