A couple of NaNoWriMos ago [I mentioned](/blog/2016/12/01/nanowrimo-2016/) that I'd made a Twine 2 replacement for the popular scrolling/stretchtext story format Jonah from Twine 1.  I didn't port Jonah itself; instead I based [Paloma](/tools/scree/paloma/) on Chris Klimas' minimalist Twine 2 story format [Snowman](https://github.com/klembot/snowman).  At the time I also threatened to backport Paloma to Twine 1, which I apparently did soon afterwards, as well as tossing in some special passages (versions 1.0.1 and 1.1.0).

Today's version, 1.1.1, fixes an iPhone < 6 issue involving tiny fonts on tiny screens.
