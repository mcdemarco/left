Via [Night Shade Books](http://www.nightshadebooks.com/2008/07/22/the-big-idea-behind-incandescence/):   John Scalzi has [a guest post by Greg Egan](http://scalzi.com/whatever/?p=1064) discussing his new novel *Incandescence*.

> So for us, astronomy was crucial even to reach as far as Newton, and postulating Einstein’s theory — let alone validating it to high precision, with atomic clocks on satellites and observations of pulsar orbits — depended on a wealth of other ideas and technologies.
>
> How, then, could my alien civilization possibly reach the same conceptual heights, when they were armed with none of these apparent prerequisites?<!--break--> The short answer is that they would need to be living in just the right environment: the accretion disk of a large black hole.
