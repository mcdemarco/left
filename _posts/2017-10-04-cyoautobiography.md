I was reading a [hyperfiction multireddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/pellucidar7/m/cyoa/) yesterday when I stumbled across a 2015 adult Choose Your Own Adventure-style book that I'd somehow missed, Neil Patrick Harris' [*Choose Your Own Autobiography*](http://nphbook.com/about-the-book/):

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385347014/ref=as_li_ss_il?&linkCode=li2&tag=mcdema-20&linkId=6b72ea380785b57608e9ed759ceaba61" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0385347014&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=mcdema-20" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=mcdema-20&l=li2&o=1&a=0385347014" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

I read a few pages of the Amazon preview; it seems to be a nice mix of actual autobiography and slapstick alternate life-history.

The classic of adult choosing-your-own-adventure is, of course, Kim Newman's *Life's Lottery* (1999).  I got it back when it was rare (I'm a total hyperfiction hipster that way), but it was reprinted a few years ago:

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lifes-Lottery-Kim-Newman/dp/1781165564/ref=as_li_ss_il?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=&linkCode=li2&tag=mcdema-20&linkId=0d21cdd4601cdb546921e4674bb52108" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=1781165564&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=mcdema-20" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=mcdema-20&l=li2&o=1&a=1781165564" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

### Update

Apparently there's also a Kindle edition of *Life's Lottery*, which is rumored to be [buggy](https://gamebooks.org/Series/2).  *Caveat emptor.*
