Via [del.icio.us scifi](http://www.mcdemarco.net/aggregator/sources/25):  an old BoingBoing post, [Brooklyn residents: just say no to space elevators!](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/02/01/brooklyn_residents_j.html)   My favorite line was:

> Don't sit idly by and let this elevator cast its impossibly long, cold, and very narrow shadow over our homes!
