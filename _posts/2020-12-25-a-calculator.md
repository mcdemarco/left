Because I didn't like the baby age calculators already out there, I made an [adjusted age calculator](/tools/baby/aac.html) that will save dates across sessions and give adjusted and unadjusted ages in various formats.  It can also determine due date from the last period or vice versa.  Made with [moment.js](https://momentjs.com) and vanilla JavaScript.
