Via a mailing list:  a Wired story, [Video Shills for Literary Stars](http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,67076,00.html), on online Flash advertising for books.  The price seems too high for authors to VidLit their own works, though I suppose a hopeful publisher might be willing to shell out $3,500 per minute.
