Sadly, [Decision Fiction](http://web.archive.org/web/20191220030942/https://www.decisionfiction.com/) has passed from the [up-and-comers](/tools/hyperfic/software.html#The.Up-and-Comers) to the down-and-outers.  But don't despair, there are plenty more where that came from:

* [Sadako](http://web.archive.org/web/20200906224853/https://github.com/Tayruh/sadako/) compares itself to Twine, ChoiceScript, and Ink, but looks very little like Twine, a lot like ChoiceScript, and even more like Ink
* [Toothrot](https://github.com/toothrot-if) is a similarly Ink-y choice engine
* [Ramus](https://notimetoplay.org/engines/ramus/) is an HTML-based (as in, writing your own HTML with a few special attributes) hypertext system 
* [Elm Story](https://elmstorygames.itch.io/elm-story/devlog/247809/introducing-elm-story-a-free-no-code-pro-tool-designed-to-help-authors-game-designers-and-students-develop-and-publish-interactive-narrative-experiences) is an even GUI-er approach to choice fiction than Twine, with ambitions of becoming a cloud service when it grows up
* [Gordian Book](https://gordianbook.art) is an online converter from (script-free) Twine to PDF gamebooks
* [pangamebook](https://github.com/lifelike/pangamebook) is the pandoc filter successor to [gamebookformat](https://github.com/lifelike/gamebookformat)
* [Another RPG Engine](https://anotherrpgenthusiast.itch.io/another-rpg-engine/devlog/259078/version-303), the Twine/SugarCube plugin, is up to v3.0.3
