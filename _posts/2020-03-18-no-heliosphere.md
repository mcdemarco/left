[Heliosphere](http://www.heliosphereny.org) has been cancelled along with everything else.  But, despite the fact that everyone is now on the viral news train and talking coronavirus all the time, [PlagueBlog](http://plagueblog.blogspot.com/) goes on.  Today is [Day 47](https://plagueblog.blogspot.com/2020/03/day-47-200k-and-still-rising.html) of COVID-19 in Boston.

For those of you stuck at home and/or nervous about take-out, I've updated the [cookbook](/recipes/).
