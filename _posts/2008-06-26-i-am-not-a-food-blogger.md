I am not a food blogger; I just owe someone a recipe.  I'm including a bonus recipe as well:

* [Fig Anchoiade](http://www.recipezaar.com/294334):  You can't go wrong with anchovies.
* [Authentic biscotti](http://www.recipezaar.com/300513):  Who knew you could make cookies with olive oil?

Usually I prefer to use cookbooks, but I found both of these at [RecipeZaar](http://www.recipezaar.com/).
