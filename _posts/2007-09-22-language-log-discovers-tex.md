I noticed the mis-take in a [old Language Log post on hyphenization](http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/004660.html):

>  In any case, pro-ofreaders were clearly not obsolete then.  Nor are they now.  Though brute-force methods -- really really big dictionaries with possible hyphenations specified -- can improve things considerably, and undoubtedly have.

But I knew TeX had a famous (well, to TeX geeks) hyphenation algorithm that was rumored to never mishy-phenate.<!--break-->

Apparently I was not the only one to notice.  So to recover their moral high ground over [the BBC](http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003507.html), Language Log has posted [a co-rrection](http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004946.html), on the occasion of a [great hyphen leak at the sOED](http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004945.html).
