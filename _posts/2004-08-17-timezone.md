 This server is on Pacific Daylight Time, so I downloaded Mark Ivey's [Timezone 0.0.3](http://zovirl.com/2004/software/blosxom/plugins/timezone/) to adjust Blosxom's timestamps to my time.  (The Timezone plugin listed at [blosxom.com](http://www.blosxom.com/plugins/date/timezone.htm) is an older version with fewer features.)

The instructions could be clearer; here's what I did:

1. Edited the plugin file, changing PST8PDT to my timezone, EST5EDT. 1. Renamed the plugin `timezone` and put it in my plugins directory. 3. Edited my story.html flavour to tack the timezone on to my signature, thus:  `mcd | $hr:$min $timezone::name`
