I've downloaded my Instagram photos using [Instaport](http://instaport.me/) and laid them out as [Polaroids](/stream/instagrams/).  The polaroid styling is based on [Polaroids with CSS3](http://www.zurb.com/playground/css3-polaroids) on Zurb and a similar post by [Paulund](http://www.paulund.co.uk/create-polaroid-image-with-css).  I tweaked them a little and added the handwriting font, a Google web font called [Patrick Hand SC](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Patrick+Hand+SC).

If you want to make your own, you can see and steal my CSS at the bottom of [my main style file](/css/base.css).  [Google](http://www.google.com/fonts/) has instructions for adding individual web fonts, or you can copy the link to the font from the source of the [Polaroids page](/stream/instagrams/), near the top.  Some grungier details follow; feel free to stop reading now.

I ended up putting the link list together manually because Jekyll [still doesn't include](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/pull/585) basic image gallery or file listing functionality and the plugins I tried didn't work out---partly because I was unwilling to wipe out my macports directory to satisfy [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/)'s polite and clear but excessive requirements.  I made the thumbnails with ImageMagick, which I happened to have lying around the Mac.

The export from Instagram didn't capture my titles, so I added them manually and titled the untitled photos.
