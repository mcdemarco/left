While doing some research for a story, I stumbled across the NYU Media Research Lab's [Fractal Planet applet](http://mrl.nyu.edu/projects/texture/planet.html), with its nifty sliders to add more rock, coral, cloudy and other bling to the planet.  There's a link there to [movies](http://mrl.nyu.edu/~danielk/planet/) of a 4D version of the planet.

My surfing--uh, research--also led me to two versions of Ken Perlin's Webwide World:  <!--break--> [a smaller one](http://mrl.nyu.edu/~perlin/experiments/demox/Planet.html) with a Fractal Planet-like interface, minus the sliders, and [a bigger one](http://mrl.nyu.edu/~perlin/planet/) which makes up for the complete lack of bling with double the image size.

Click with caution; fractals are addictive.
