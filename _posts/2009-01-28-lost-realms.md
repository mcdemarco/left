Via a mailing list:  [SFScope reports](http://sfscope.com/2009/01/realms-of-fantasy-closing.html) that [*Realms of Fantasy*](http://www.sovhomestead.com/thankyou.htm) will be shutting down after their April 2009 issue, apparently due to slow newsstand sales.  With the [recent news](http://www.tor.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=blog&id=11376) that *The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction* is cutting back to bimonthly publication, the market for short fantasy fiction is looking down.
