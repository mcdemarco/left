[Jennifer Government](http://www.maxbarry.com/jennifergovernment/) was a [finalist](http://www.ku.edu/~sfcenter/campbell-finalists.htm)  for the [John W. Campbell Award](http://www.ku.edu/~sfcenter/campbell.htm) this year.  Max Barry tells the amusing story of [how he found out](http://www.maxbarry.com/2004/08/31/news.html#campbell).

The novel inspired a free online game, [NationStates](http://www.nationstates.net/cgi-bin/index.cgi):

> Build a nation and run it according to your own warped political
> ideals. Create a Utopian paradise for society's less fortunate or a
> totalitarian corporate police state. Care for your people or
> deliberately oppress them. Join the United Nations or remain a rogue
> state. It's really up to you.
