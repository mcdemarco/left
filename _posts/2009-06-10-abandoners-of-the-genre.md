At io9, interviews with [four authors who may or may not have left the genre](http://io9.com/5285084/4-authors-we-wish-would-return-to-science-fiction).  Most notable of the bunch was Mary Doria Russell, whose next novel will be a Western---pretty much the only genre with less demographic appeal than science fiction, so maybe it will drive her back into the fold.

> This new book is in some ways a classical Western about Doc Holliday and Wyatt Earp, but I see John Henry Holliday as a heartbreaking figure: born in the antebellum South, educated in the North for a professional life in the East, trying not to die on the rawest frontier of the West.<!--break--> Doc might as well have been THE MAN WHO FELL TO EARTH: frail, lonely and desperately homesick, surrounded by people who are not nearly as sophisticated or educated as he was. At the same time, this story is a murder mystery set in Dodge City in 1878.
