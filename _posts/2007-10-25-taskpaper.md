It's been a while since I blogged about Getting Things Done, but a few days ago I spotted a new kid on the productivity block (in [John Gruber's linkblog](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/october#mon-22-taskpaper)).  [TaskPaper](http://hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper), is the ultimate lightweight GTD application--so simple you could be using paper itself.<!--break-->  It goes without saying these days that this new cool indie product is for the Mac.

I downloaded TaskPaper immediately, but didn't install it until tonight, after having tried out [TaskPaper.web](http://hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper_web) at work.  The web version is more colorful than the black-and-white Mac application; I found a few preferences to tweak, but TaskPaper still lives up to its promise of being nearly untweakable.  It's the GTD version of the distraction-suppressing 
 [WriteRoom](http://hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom), the second-simplest method out there.  Here's [#1](http://www.sizemore.co.uk/visiblemonsters/2007/04/10/gttfd-with-henry-rollins/), but beware of vulgarity.

The [user guide](http://hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper/user_guide) is very basic but there's an extremely thorough review at [The Unofficial Apple Weblog](http://www.tuaw.com/2007/10/25/taskpaper-1-0-a-review/), perhaps inspired by [this promise of free license keys to reviewers](http://hogbaysoftware.com/forums/hog_bay_software/topics/263_Looking_for_TaskPaper_and_WriteRoom_reviews).  (I'm not fishing for a license, just providing a relevant writing link.)  I doubt mere simplicity can keep TaskPaper out of my tarpit of abandoned GTD applications, but if I does I'll report my progress in a later post.
