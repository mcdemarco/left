Yesterday's cat-vacuuming activity was updating my [catalog of Twine story formats](/tools/twine/catalog/), inspired by my discovery of [AdventureTome](https://sophiehoulden.com/twine/adventuretome_guide.html) in the [IFTF forums](https://intfiction.org/c/authoring/twine/46).  I also fixed the misnaming of icon files and dealt with the growing phenomena of not naming your format file `format.js` and/or not marking your proofing-style formats as proofing formats.
