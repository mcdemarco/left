Via [GeekPress](http://www.geekpress.com/2006/10/6-word-short-stories.html):  Wired has an article up chock full of [Very Short Stories](http://wired.com/wired/archive/14.11/sixwords.html).  See also the cool [six word novel graphics](http://blog.wired.com/sixwords/).  The title of this post is my own attempt at the ultra-short genre.<!--break-->
