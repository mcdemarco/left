I saw [Cloverfield](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloverfield) tonight, and loved the smashing of Manhattan and eating of whiny 20-somethings.  It reminded me of a link in my to-blog list:  [Look on my works, ye mighty, and  despair](http://gerrycanavan.blogspot.com/2008/01/look-on-my-works-ye-mighty-and-despair.html) is Gerry Canavan's collection of post-apocalyptic images of the Statue of Liberty.

> ... in connection with Ryan's theory that the most salient feature of apocalypse in science fiction is the way in which the same images are simply repackaged for us over and over again, I was struck by the recurrence of a ruined Statue of Liberty as perhaps the quintessential icon of disaster since the 1940s.
