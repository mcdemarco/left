 The topic of conlanging manifestoes came up recently on the conlang list.  I enjoyed reading the [Conlang Manifesto, Artlanger's Rant](http://students.washington.edu/jaspax/conlang.htm), and an [Apologia pro Imaginatione](http://www.valdyas.org/apologia.html). Although the manifestoes primarily defend language construction, they apply equally well to conculturing (constructing cultures) and to fiction writing in general.
