Via [twitter](http://twitter.com/sfwa/status/9337935869):  nominations for the Nebula Awards are up at [sfwa.org](http://www.sfwa.org/2010/02/2009-nebula-awards-final-ballot/).  I think the only thing I've read this year is Michael Burstein's "I Remember the Future," but several of the shorter works are linked so I can catch up.
