The November issue of IGMS asked the question, [Why Do People Not Read Science Fiction?](http://www.intergalacticmedicineshow.com/cgi-bin/mag.cgi?do=columns&vol=carol_pinchefsky&article=014)  I spotted an interesting theory on a mailing list--because [Sept. 11 Killed Star Trek](http://www.syfyportal.com/news423092.html):

> It's a cliche, albeit it [sic] a truthful one, that everything changed on 9/11 --- including, most importantly, that ephemeral quality known as the zeitgeist, defined as the general trend of thought or feeling characteristic of a particular period of time. And Star Trek -- bright, shiny, optimistic Star Trek with its well-lit bridge and its going boldly and all --- it no longer held the general trend or feeling characteristic of the time after the towers fell.<!--break-->

The real answer is probably one of the choices from the IGMS article, though:

> Science fiction just does not interest most readers.
