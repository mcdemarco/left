Via NASA's [Space Weather](http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2009/21jan_severespaceweather.htm) site:  a novel disaster scenario, a super solar flare followed by a geomagnetic storm that could permanently fry transformers across our over-connected power grids.

> At the moment, no one knows when the next super solar storm will erupt. It could be 100 years away or just 100 days.
