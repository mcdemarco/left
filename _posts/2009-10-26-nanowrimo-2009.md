Sign up at [the National Novel Writing Month site](http://www.nanowrimo.org/).  Check out [this MacWorld video](http://www.macworld.com/article/143348/2009/10/mwvodcast130.html) about writing tools for the Mac; my favorite was [Freedom](http://macfreedom.com/), a program to cut off your internet connection for a fixed period of time.  Also, Scrivener has [a special trial offer](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/nanowrimo.html) of their writing software for NaNoWriMo participants.
