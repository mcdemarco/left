Via BoardGameNews: <!-- http://www.boardgamenews.com/index.php/boardgamenews/comments/boardgames_australia_promoting_games_and_a_new_game_award/ -->   Boardgames Australia has a page devoted to [games featuring sheep](http://www.boardgamesaustralia.org.au/play/have-a-games-night/27-games-that-feature-sheep), with ovine-centric reviews.

> Despite the comic and cuddly look of the sheep pieces, [Shear Panic] is an intense game of struggling for the best position in the flock.
