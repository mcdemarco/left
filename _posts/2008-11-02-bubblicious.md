From NaNoWriMo's [Procrastination Station](http://www.nanowrimo.org/taxonomy/term/112), a cool mind-mapping link:  [bubbl.us](http://www.bubbl.us/) lets you mind-map online, then exports your mind maps to various formats.  It's free and doesn't require registration, even though it looks like it does.
