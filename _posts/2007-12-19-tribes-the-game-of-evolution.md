It may not be [Spore](http://www.spore.com/), but [Tribes](http://www.sjgames.com/tribes/) is a game of some science fictional interest, having been designed by David Brin and [Steve Jackson](http://www.io.com/~sj/).

> In Tribes, the players are cave men and women. They hunt and gather food, make their tribal laws, and deal with natural disasters. But the object of the game is simple: Look after the children!<!--break--> In this game, the way to win is to have the most kids, and do whatever you have to do to make sure they survive to adulthood. The players must know when to cooperate, and when to cut their losses and protect their own families.
