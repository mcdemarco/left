Here are some fun and interesting linguistics links I found, starting from [this LJ post](http://ozarque.livejournal.com/254704.html) by Suzette Haden Elgin:  [Phonosemantic Coherence in English Assonances](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jlawler/assonances.pdf) is an intriguing list of correlations between meaning and initial consonant clusters; [How to Make a Linguistic Theory](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jlawler/theory.how.html) should be titled How Not to Make a Linguistic Theory; and [the Chomskybot](http://rubberducky.org/cgi-bin/chomsky.pl) will make your theory for you.
