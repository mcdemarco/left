I didn't support the [Kingdom Builder: Marshlands](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/179622/kingdom-builder-marshlands) kickstarter and I haven't gotten a copy yet, but I spotted a couple of requests for an updated Kingdom Builder randomizer in the BoardGameGeek forums and promised to update mine.  It turned out to be a relatively simple update; try it out [here](/tools/kb/randomizer.html), or check out the source [at github](https://github.com/mcdemarco/kingdom-builder-randomizer).

Also sporting minor updates today is my [cookbook](/recipes/).  Feel free to let me know if you find bugs in either one.

It's getting cooler out, and that means [NaNoWriMo is coming](http://nanowrimo.org/)...
