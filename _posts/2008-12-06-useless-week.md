Walter Jon Williams blogged last week about [Useless Day](http://walterjonwilliams.blogspot.com/2008/12/useless-day.html), the unpredictable day of the week on which he gets nothing done.  I measure my writing in weeks, so I have Useless Weeks instead.  The first week of December, for example, is always a Useless Week of goofing off after NaNoWriMo.<!--break-->

Having discovered for the seventh year in a row that, while I can type 50,000 words in a row, I still can't write a novel, the question arises:  what next?  Before November struck I was having a flash fiction phase, so it seems likely I'll go back to that.  On the other hand, with one Useless Week down, only three remain before the next [WotF](http://www.writersofthefuture.com/rules.htm) deadline, so I may put off the flash and start on a longer short story instead.

Congratulations to Amy Tibbetts, a fellow Odyssey grad I spotted on the latest [list of Honorable Mentions](http://wotfblog.galaxypress.com/2008/12/2nd-set-of-honorable-mentions-for-4th.html) for the WotF contest.
