Once again, someone posted to the NaNoWriMo forums [looking for mapping software](http://www.nanowrimo.org/eng/node/3020623), and I replied.  The situation doesn't look much better than it did two NaNo's ago when I posted on [the state of mapping software for the Mac](/node/284).

Here's the shortened list:

* [Google SketchUp](http://sketchup.google.com/) for free 3D mapping.
* [AutoREALM](http://sourceforge.net/projects/autorealm/) for free 2D mapping on Windows.
* [Stonesword](http://www.stonesword.com/) for free 2D mapping online.
* [Gozzy's](http://www.gozzys.com/) for gorgeous but random/premade free 2D maps online.
* [Dundjinni](http://www.dundjinni.com/info/demo.htm) for non-free 2D mapping, but there's a free demo.
* [ProFantasy](http://www.profantasy.com/) or [Fractal Mapper](http://www.nbos.com/products/mapper/mapper.htm) for non-free 2D mapping on Windows.

I think there was another fairly sophisticated program for Windows, but I can't find it now.
