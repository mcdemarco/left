As mentioned [previously](/blog/2016/12/01/nanowrimo-2016/), I made a "proofing format" for graphing a Twine hypertext story, [DotGraph](/tools/scree/dotgraph/), which produces graphs in the style of [this Chimney Rock map](http://www.seanmichaelragan.com/html/%5B2008-03-07%5D_Choose_Your_Own_Adventure_book_as_directed_graph.shtml).  Today's update to version 2.0.2 adds support for omitting passages by tag, and officially releases the existing 2.0.1 support for displaying `<<display>>` links.
