Via [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/03/21/028208):  In [Learning a Language in the Digital Age](http://ummianum.typepad.com/my_weblog/2005/03/learning_a_lang.html), UmmRa reviews several flashcard programs:

> For the money, features, or whateverthehell&trade; else you take into account, <a href="http://www.loopware.com/iflash/">iFlash</a> is the best language program out there.  Sorry Windows users, this one is only available for Macs.  Not only does it support a sizable (and free!) library of user-inputted decks, but you can also add image and audio files to your cards.  The ease of use and organization here are superb.

Needless to say, you can make flashcard libraries for your conlangs, too.

A Slashdot commenter mentioned the [LaTeX flashcards class](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/flashcards/?action=/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/) for printing out flashcards.  Another pointed out that
if you want to learn a digital language for a digital age,  Microsoft has a [computer slang primer](http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security/children/kidtalk.mspx).
