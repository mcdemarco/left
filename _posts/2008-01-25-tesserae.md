Another cool game I learned at Arisia was [Tesserae](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/30318) by Jonathan Venezian.  It's a tile-laying game with shapes resembling [unmarked rhombuses for a Penrose tiling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_tiling#Rhombus_tiling_.28P3.29).  Since actual Penrose tiles are [so hard to come by](http://ask.metafilter.com/21414/Bathroom-Penrose-tiles), I'd be tempted to mark up the backs and have two toys for the price of one.<!--break-->

You can pick up a copy at various [Boston game stores and museum shops](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/278218), or contact Jonathan to get Tesserae into your area game store.
