I've been meaning to add a new productivity category for a while now:  GTD stands for Getting Things Done.  I learned about GTD at [43folders](http://www.43folders.com/).  Today's productivity links come from the same source.

* [TaDa Lists](http://www.tadalist.com/) are on-line to do lists that can be shared.
* [GTD TiddlyWiki](http://shared.snapgrid.com/gtd_tiddlywiki.html) puts to do into wiki format.
