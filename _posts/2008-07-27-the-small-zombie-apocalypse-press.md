Via a contributor and fellow Odfellow:  [Bits of the Dead](http://www.amazon.com/Bits-Dead-Anthology-Piers-Anthony/dp/1897217811) is a zombie flash fiction anthology out from [Coscom Entertainment](http://www.coscomentertainment.com/).

In my search for the publisher I came across another small zombie-apocalypse press, [Permuted Press](http://permutedpress.com/), with an anthology currently open for August:  [The World is Dead](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103060955/http://permutedpress.com/worldisdead.php), paying a penny a word.

I also found some exhaustive lists of [new zombie fiction](http://web.archive.org/web/20180311140530/http://www.allthingszombie.com/books.php) and [reviews](http://web.archive.org/web/20180311140053/http://www.allthingszombie.com/books_reviews.php) at All Things Zombie, which led me to last year's *Monster Planet* [available [free online](http://www.brokentype.com/planet/) or from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Monster-Planet-Zombie-David-Wellington/dp/1560258675)], the third volume in a zombie apocalypse series I've been reading.  Apparently *Publishers Weekly* has declared 2008 the Year of the Zombie, so I'm not as late to the brains party as I'd thought.
