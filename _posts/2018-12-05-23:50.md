I have a little [G. K. Chesterton page](/gkc/) with [quotes](/gkc/quotes/quotes.html) that I first put online back before many of the people his quotes apply to today were even born.  But then, he said them long before I was born, so I suppose I shouldn't be surprised at his staying power.  I just didn't expect him to become [*more*](https://areomagazine.com/2018/08/04/hating-whites-online-sarah-jeongs-tweets-and-anti-white-racism/) relevant, and to find myself quoting him even more frequently:

> I'm still a liberal. It's those people who aren't liberals.
