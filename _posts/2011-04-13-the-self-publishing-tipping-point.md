I found my way from [Dean Wesley Smith's twitter feed](http://twitter.com/#!/DeanWesleySmith) to L. M. May's posts on [learned helplessness](http://lmmay.com/2011/04/03/fiction-writers-and-learned-helplessness/) and [Barry Eisler going indie](https://web.archive.org/web/20120304145637/http://lmmay.com/2011/03/21/barry-eisler-turned-down-500000-deal-to-indie-publish/).  I read Barry Eisler's long [two](http://barryeisler.blogspot.com/2011/03/ebooks-and-self-publishing-conversation.html) [part](http://barryeisler.blogspot.com/2011/04/ebooks-and-self-publishing-part-2.html) dialogue with Joe Konrath about self-publishing.  Dean has since posted some more self-publishing advice.

By chance I also found [a very short post by David Friedman](http://daviddfriedman.blogspot.com/2011/03/how-to-eliminate-publishing-industry.html) about how little need for the publishing industry remains after the advent of ebooks---a reprise of a three-year-old post whose time has now come.  Also by chance, I just got my first royalty payment for *Paramourtal* last week, and my mother(!) got a Kindle at the same time.

It all added up for me to a tipping point for self-publishing.  It's no longer the crazy aunt of publishing options; now it's the best practice (to pick a painful phrase from the wealth of jargon I've been hearing at the [BioIT World conference](http://www.bio-itworldexpo.com/Bio-It_Expo_Content.aspx?id=102622) in Boston this week).  I no longer picture myself submitting short stories and (future) novels to sink in the slush swamps of traditional publishers on the side while I keep my day job; instead I see myself publishing my own books and (possibly) making decent money at it.  I find my new vision of the future much more inspiring---thus my resolve to get back on the wagon.

That's a lot to read into one PayPal payment and a few blog posts, but it's more a matter of intuition than of deduction.  Where else can the industry go at this point?

An update via [Dean](http://twitter.com/#!/DeanWesleySmith/status/58427999455940608):  [CNNMoney reports on the tipping point at B&N](http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/04/13/why-barnes-noble-should-go-from-bookstore-to-nookstore/), including the words "tipping point" and the prediction that "ebooks will dominate sales within the next 24 months."
