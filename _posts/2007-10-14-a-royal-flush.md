Despite the [little grey man's predictions](/node/343), Doris Lessing won the 2007 Nobel Prize in literature.  She missed the call and got the news from reporters lying in wait at her home.  [A Reuters TV crew](http://www.reuters.com/article/reutersEdge/idUSL1363610220071014?pageNumber=1&sp=true) attempted to interview her:

> "Isn't this a recognition of your life's work?" I persisted.
> 
> "Yes, it is. See, you've said it all for me," the feisty and prolific author responded, turning to head indoors.<!--break-->
>
> A radio journalist asked her to appear on air. She snapped back that she would have to think of something suitable to say.
>
> Clearly she was not going to make it easy.
>
> I managed to get her to turn around when she was half-way up the garden path by asking her if prizes meant anything to her as obviously they were not the reason she wrote books.
>
> "Look I have won all the prizes in Europe, every bloody one. I'm delighted to win them all, okay?" she responded testily.

> As an afterthought she turned around and mumbled:
>
>"It's a royal flush."

In response to some harsh criticism from Harold Bloom, the
New York Times reprinted [a 1992 essay of hers on political correctness](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/13/opinion/13lessing.html?_r=2&oref=slogin&oref=slogin):

> A very common way of thinking in literary criticism is not seen as a consequence of Communism, but it is. Every writer has the experience of being told that a novel, a story, is “about” something or other. I wrote a story, “The Fifth Child,” which was at once pigeonholed as being about the Palestinian problem, genetic research, feminism, anti-Semitism and so on.

> A journalist from France walked into my living room and before she had even sat down said, “Of course ‘The Fifth Child’ is about AIDS.”
>
> An effective conversation stopper, I assure you. But what is interesting is the habit of mind that has to analyze a literary work like this. If you say, “Had I wanted to write about AIDS or the Palestinian problem I would have written a pamphlet,” you tend to get baffled stares. That a work of the imagination has to be “really” about some problem is, again, an heir of Socialist Realism. To write a story for the sake of storytelling is frivolous, not to say reactionary.
>
> The demand that stories must be “about” something is from Communist thinking and, further back, from religious thinking, with its desire for self-improvement books as simple-minded as the messages on samplers.
>
> The phrase “political correctness” was born as Communism was collapsing. I do not think this was chance. I am not suggesting that the torch of Communism has been handed on to the political correctors. I am suggesting that habits of mind have been absorbed, often without knowing it.

In the interest of full disclosure, I must admit that I didn't expect the Nobel any more than Doris Lessing did, and that I heard about it from [Fake Steve Jobs](http://fakesteve.blogspot.com/2007/10/doris-lessing-on-political-correctness.html), of all places.
