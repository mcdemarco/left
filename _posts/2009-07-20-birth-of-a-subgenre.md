Not quite as significant as the [birth of a genre](/node/621), the birth of a subgenre really only needs someone to give to airy nothing a local habitation and a name.  [Schott's Vocab](http://schott.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/17/literary-monster-mash-up/) documents the origin of a new one:

>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies has sold over 50,000 copies in the UK and 600,000 in the US since publication in April, sparking a new trend for what [publisher] Quirk has dubbed the “literary monster mash-up.”<!--break-->

>Other publishers have rushed to jump onto the bandwagon, and this autumn will see publication of both “Queen Victoria: Demon Hunter” – subtitled “She Loved Her Country; She Hated Demons” - and “I am Scrooge: A Zombie Story for Christmas.” “Marley was dead. Again,” says its publisher Orion. “Will the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future be able to stop the world from drowning under a top-hatted and crinolined zombie horde?”
