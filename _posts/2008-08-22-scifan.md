Via [del.icio.us sf](/aggregator/sources/24):  [SciFan](http://www.scifan.com/) is a database of science fiction and fantasy, classified by theme, author, series, and more.  Although the site looks old and perhaps moribund, they assure readers they're still active:

> We update our database almost daily, with the ambition to make it a comprehensive and accurate resource for bibliographies and biographies in our favorite genres. As of today we include 67385 books, 18275 writers, 8195 series & 4285 web links.

I clicked around and found a few new and forthcoming novels of interest under "themes," which covers everything from subgenres to settings.  I also discovered that Walter Jon Williams has [a hardcover coming out from Orbit next year](http://www.scifan.com/titles/title.asp?TI_titleid=68768).
