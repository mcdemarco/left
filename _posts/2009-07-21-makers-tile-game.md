It's more of a toy than a real game, but [Tor.com has announced](http://www.tor.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=blog&id=47966) the *Makers* Tile Game, v. 2x2, as part of the [serialization](http://www.tor.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=blog&id=37468) of the eponymous Cory Doctorow novel.

**Update:** The 2x2 tile game (~~https://www.tor.com/images/stories/blogs/makers-tile-game/~~) and its successors are all 404.  Like Flash itself, they're dead; the Internet just doesn't know it yet.
