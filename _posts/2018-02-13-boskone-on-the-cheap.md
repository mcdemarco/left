In [my previous post](/blog/2018/02/08/boskone55/) about Boskone 55, I forgot to mention that once again you can try the convention out for free for Friday afternoon from 2pm to 6pm, which includes a couple of the panels I'm on: "My Favorite Game" <!--https://sites.grenadine.co/sites/boskone/en/boskone-55/schedule/2987/My+Favorite+Game --> at 3pm and "Revisiting Big Dumb Objects" <!-- https://sites.grenadine.co/sites/boskone/en/boskone-55/schedule/3032/Revisiting+Big+Dumb+Objects --> at 4pm.  The full free schedule is [online](https://b55.boskone.org/program-event/schedule-text-view/).
