Via [del.icio.us](/aggregator/sources/24):  [CNN reports](http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/TV/09/02/tv.what.the.frak.ap/index.html?iref=mpstoryview) on the growing popularity of *frak*, the four-letter word coined for the original Battlestar Galactica and revived with the remake.

> The word has even appeared in the funny pages where Dilbert muttered a disconsolate "frack" -- the original spelling before producers of the current show changed it to a four-letter word -- after a particularly dumb order from his evil twit of a boss.
>
> "Dilbert" creator Scott Adams calls the word "pure genius."<!--break-->
