Via [BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2857073/game-crafter-choose-your-own-path-challenge):  The Game Crafter is running a [choose your own "path" game contest](https://www.thegamecrafter.com/contests/choose-your-own-path-challenge).  The main requirement is writing a CYOA in book format (even though their example games are all in card format) that plays in less than an hour.  Additional board-gamification is encouraged, though somewhat limited by the $50 price ceiling.  (Prices at The Game Crafter are fixed by the components used.)

While a gamebook contest seems more appropriate to [DriveThru RPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com) than The Game Crafter, the prizes are reasonably tempting.  One downside is that the game must be fully ready to sell in their store, which means creating a lot of extra assets, most onerously a semi-mandatory video.  Entries are due circa August 22nd.
