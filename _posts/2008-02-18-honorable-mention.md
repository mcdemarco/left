Thanks to Joni for calling about the [honorable mention](http://wotfblog.galaxypress.com/2008/02/more-honorable-mentions-for-1st-quarter.html) Saturday night, explaining it to me (it's the top 5% of entrants), and printing everyone's name (so if you follow the blog entries about this quarter you can extrapolate a rough total number of submissions).<!--more-->

I dimly recall my late-night search for a post office last quarter, because we worked New Year's Eve this year and my after-work plans to post the submission on my way home were torpedoed by the early closing of every post office in the greater Boston area at 3 or 3:30pm.  (I forget which it was, but they all closed in sync.)

Eventually I found my way to Fort Point Station, the all-night post office behind South Station, waited in a long line of everyone in the state (and one guy from Providence) who had needed postal services after 3pm.  The point being, I remember stopping by First Night celebrations on the way home from my postal ordeal, but I still don't remember what the story was about.  I do recall the one from the quarter before, because there was a plague in it...
