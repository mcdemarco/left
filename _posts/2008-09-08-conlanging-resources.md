I've been working on my constructed language recently, so it's about time to post [this link](http://community.livejournal.com/conlangs/401687.html) from the livejournal conlangs community.  But for a better list of references I recommend [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language#References), especially [Essays on Language Design](http://www.eskimo.com/~ram/essays.html).<!--break-->

Also via [conlangs](http://community.livejournal.com/conlangs/413598.html):  Suzette Haden Elgin considers which of [the various genres of primer](http://ozarque.livejournal.com/543374.html) to use for her conlang.
