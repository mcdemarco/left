Via [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/04/30/apple-twitter):  Apple's [business profile of Twitter](http://www.apple.com/business/profiles/twitter/) focuses on simplicity and, of course, Macs.  

> “Tens of thousands of people followed the account of the touch-and-go unmanned Mars Phoenix landing, as NASA’s director of communications tweeted about key equipment procedures in real time. Twitter catalyzed an entirely new kind of public involvement in science. <!--break--> By the time the mission’s press release went out, it was old news,” says Stone. Millions of people, Stone notes, also use the service as a serious business tool for everything from communication and branding to gauging a product’s success in the market.

I'm still tweeting the pandemic, but I'm not sure what I'll do with [my twitter account](http://twitter.com/mcdemarco) once it slows down.
