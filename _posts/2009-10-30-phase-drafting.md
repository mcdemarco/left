Via a mailing list:  Johanna Harness [contemplates](http://www.johannaharness.com/2010/10/phase-drafting-novel-planning.html) a new kind of outline, [Lazette Gifford's phase drafting](http://www.fmwriters.com/Visionback/Issue%2015/phase.htm), just in time for NaNoWriMo.

> I was attempting to do the pre-rough draft by writing more about each chapter.  It was going okay, but the ideas werenâ€™t flowing as well as they do in full rough-draft writing.
>
> By breaking scenes into phases, the action flows.  There may be 300 or more phases to be developed in the rough draft.  Each phase becomes a writing prompt.
>
> Gifford also presents good ideas about how to keep your writing on track for word count, how to set goals, when to add or subtract phases.  Her short article is a gold mine of information.

Gifford reports speeds of up to 10,000 words per day using this method.

**Update**:  Johanna's original post, ~~http://www.johannaharness.com/Johanna_Harness/Blog/Entries/2009/9/3_Phase_Drafting.html~~ was merged into a later one, *Phase Drafting (Novel Planning)*, linked above; the original post corresponds to the second half, subtitled *Phase Drafting:  September 3, 2009*.
