Via a mailing list:  The [Sony Reader](http://products.sel.sony.com/pa/PRS/index.html) is due out this spring.  At 5" x 7" it's almost as small as a paperback and uses print-like [E Ink](http://www.eink.com/) technology.  

But considering the proprietary book format (Sony's BBeB) and the fact that the Sony Connect store [requires Internet Explorer](http://www.connect.com/non_ie.html)--not the browser of choice for [early adopters](http://www.zonalatina.com/Zldata99.htm)--the Sony Reader may not be the next iPod after all.
