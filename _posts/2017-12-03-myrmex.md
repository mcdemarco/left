[Myrmex](http://mcdemarco.github.io/myrmex/) is one of my [JavaScript implementations](/games/decktet/) of Decktet games.  The new version, 1.2, is slightly less buggy than the previous, unannounced versions, so you should just be able to play without obvious bugs.  (If you do experience a bug, the solution is to save the game with the Save button, then restore it immediately with the Resume button.)  Myrmex is also set up so you can play it offline and/or save it to your iDevice home screen.
