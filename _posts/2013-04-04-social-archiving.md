The rest of the static website has now been converted to static website, and I tossed in one social media archive, [twitter](/social/tweets/), along with a primitive proto-twitter [noteboard](/social/notes/) that I used back in the day.  I'm not quite ready to upload it all to my official host, so for now the new website is still hanging out at [github](mcdemarco.github.com).
