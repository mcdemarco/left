I found the hefty tome that is *Anathem* by Neal Stephenson at the library and decided to borrow it for a few months to read it.  I [blogged about it briefly](http://www.mcdemarco.net/node/465) when it first came out, but since then a few more links have accumulated.  [Futurismic](http://futurismic.com/2008/09/03/weird/) linked a video interview with the author, and [The Long Now](http://blog.longnow.org/2008/07/21/anathem-and-long-now/) blogged about being the horologic inspiration behind the novel.
