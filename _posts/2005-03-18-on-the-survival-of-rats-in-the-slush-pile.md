Someone on one of my mailing lists mentioned [On the Survival of Rats in the Slush Pile](http://web.archive.org/web/20100107032810/http://www.kingsfieldpublications.co.uk/rats.html) by Michael Allen.  From the blurb:

>  In his latest extended essay, Allen uses the ideas of the mathematician-philosopher Nassim Nicholas Taleb to demonstrate that success for writers and publishers is governed by randomness (chance) to a far greater extent than is generally realised.
