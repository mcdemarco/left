Via [Gene Expression](http://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/10/donors-choose.php):  Give the gift of science fiction (or at least, of medical thrillers) to urban high school students in Bridgeport, Connecticut, through [Donors Choose](http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/proposal.html?id=112105&challengeid=17147&zone=0).

> During our studies of genetics, students expressed interest in some controversial applications of genetic technologies. I believe their interest in the topic has opened a door for me to introduce them to modern science fiction, specifically the book "Next" by Michael Crichton.<!--break--> I believe that this book will catch their interest and allow them an opportunity to discuss the application of the genetic technologies which they have recently learned about, as well as encourage skills necessary for reading comprehension and critical thinking.
