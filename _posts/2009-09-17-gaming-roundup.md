I caught up on [Purple Pawn](http://www.purplepawn.com/) today and found all sorts of interesting gaming information:

* A [game-themed crossword puzzle](http://www.purplepawn.com/2009/08/board-game-themed-crossword-puzzle-from-merl-reagle/).
* A guide to open-source [retro RPGs](http://totheblogmobile.com/2009/05/08/a-guide-to-retro-clone-roleplaying-games/).
* [Settlers of Catan online for beginners](http://www.purplepawn.com/2009/09/catan-for-beginners-online/) (but the Java interface didn't work for me).
* [Arimaa](http://arimaa.com/arimaa/): making chess harder for computers to play.<!--break-->
* A paper about [making advanced Monte-Carlo Settlers bots](http://ticc.uvt.nl/icga/acg12/proceedings/Contribution100.pdf), and other [gaming theory research](http://www.purplepawn.com/2009/08/academic-game-scholarship-roundup/).
* Learning by gaming for [elementary school students](http://www.purplepawn.com/2009/09/quest-2-learn-grade-school-education-based-on-game-principles/) in New York City and for [project managers](http://www.purplepawn.com/2009/08/project-management-training-board-games/).
* A [job opening at Fantasy Flight Games](http://www.purplepawn.com/2009/09/job-opportunity-with-fantasy-flight-games/) in Minnesota, where the cost of living must be pretty low.
