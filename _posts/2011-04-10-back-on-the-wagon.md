[School's](http://www.brandeis.edu/gps/programscourses/programs/listings/17.html) out, probably for summer, and I've been inspired to blog again by the recent flurry of [posts on self-publishing](https://web.archive.org/web/20120304145637/http://lmmay.com/2011/03/21/barry-eisler-turned-down-500000-deal-to-indie-publish/).  But when I logged in after all these months since NaNoWriMo, Drupal distracted me from my intended topic by telling me I've been a member of my website for over six years.  It's been about that long since I sold [my first story](http://mcdemarco.net/node/76).

So I had to go dig up my [first post](/node/1) about Bloxsom and [my other first post](/node/81) about converting my blog from Bloxsom to Drupal (and from a linkblog to a real blog).  That, of course, reminded me how I really need to upgrade Drupal, and what a nightmare that always is.  I also need to update [SFFMS](/sffms/) and, you know, *write*.

Making a list is the first step...
