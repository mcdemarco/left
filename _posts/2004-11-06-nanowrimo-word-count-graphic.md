 NaNo participant [lostcarpark](http://www.nanowrimo.org/userinfo.php?uid=8930) has provided a script to display your current word count in your blog, like so:

![mcd's word count](http://www.lostcarpark.com/wordcount.php?uid=4573 "NaNoCount")

(Yes, that's my wordcount, and my working title.) For more details, see the [NaNo tech forum thread](http://www.nanowrimo.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=13340&forum=157).
