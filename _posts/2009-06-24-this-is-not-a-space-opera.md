I found *This is Not a Game* by Walter Jon Williams at the library, and Jo Walton's review of his *Dread Empire's Fall* space opera trilogy at [Tor.com](http://www.tor.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=blog&id=30151).  Commenters note that WJW is undermined by his breadth:  one year he's David Weber, the next year he's Iain M. Banks, and now he happens to be ... [Charlie Stross](), according to  a few commenters on [John Joseph Adams' Tor.com review](http://www.tor.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=blog&id=33027) of *This is Not a Game*.  (Readers apparently prefer the same damn thing over and over again.)

There's a more detailed review at [io9](http://io9.com/5192883/if-nothings-a-game-then-everything-is).
