Here's that link to romance novel parody covers that's making the rounds:  [Longmire does Romance Novels](http://www.worldoflongmire.com/features/romance_novels/readers_covers.htm).  

I followed a link from there to these Romance [Cover Contest Winners](http://www.likesbooks.com/covers.html).  Each year has a winner for worst cover, along with hilarious analysis of the runners-up.  For your convenience, here are the direct links:  

* [Worst of 1999](http://www.likesbooks.com/covrcol14g.html)
* [Worst of 2000](http://www.likesbooks.com/w-results-2000.html)
* [Worst of 2001](http://www.likesbooks.com/w-results-2001.html)
