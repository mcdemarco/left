Via [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/09/04/scifi-corridor): Martin Anderson [praises the sci-fi corridor](http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/313130/in_praise_of_the_scifi_corridor.html) at Den of Geek.

> Corridors make science-fiction believable, because they're so utilitarian by nature - really they're just a conduit to get from one (often overblown) set to another. So if any thought or love is put into one, if the production designer is smart enough to realise that corridors are the foundation on which larger sets are 'sold' to viewers, movie magic is close at hand.

He goes on to a corridor-by-corridor analysis of famous and not-so-famous sci-fi movies, with pictures.
