I've bumped [Entwee](/tools/entwee/) and [Enscree](/tools/scree/enscree/), my Twee and Multimarkdown exporters for [Twine](/tools/twine/) (respectively), with a bug fix for buggy brackets (reported by AnotherRPGEnthusiast in the Discord).  Unfortunately, bigger [Twine](https://github.com/klembot/twinejs/issues/563) [bugs](https://github.com/klembot/twinejs/issues/566) exist in proofing formats than the one I fixed, which make my changes rather academic at this point.

On the bright side, there's a beta/preview of [DotGraph as a Service](/tools/scree/dotgraph/#DotGraph.as.a.Service) that got rolled along with the above changes.  The corresponding version of DotGraph isn't out yet, but enterprising graphers can build it themselves off the [dgaas branch ~~in BitBucket~~ at GitHub](https://github.com/mcdemarco/dotgraph/tree/feature/dgaas), if they can't wait.
