Catching up on my old email from SFWire, I found this [editorial by Scott Edelman](http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue406/editorial.html) on why he won't be going to Mars.  He tried Antarctica and found he didn't have the right stuff to be an explorer:

> And so I realized, perhaps a little late in the game, that no matter what I'd been telling myself, the interplanetary explorer's life was not for me.

I think the great explorers aren't necessarily after the discomfort and danger of that life; they just prefer it over the staying at home without any fame or new horizons.  [Starsoul](http://www.musesmuse.com/ut/Myths/Starsoul.mp3) [[Urban Tapestry](http://www.musesmuse.com/ut/)] is a filk for the Shackletons still among us.
