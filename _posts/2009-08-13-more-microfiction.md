Via twitter, of course ([@eastgate](http://twitter.com/eastgate/statuses/3284731624)):  Dene Grigar's 24-hour [microfiction project](http://web.me.com/dgrigar/24-Hr._Micro-Elit_Project/Home.html) begins next Friday at midnight.

> Inspired by Richard Brautigan’s pithy “The Scarlatti Tilt”, a story of only 34 words published in 1971, my work centers around  a collection of 24 stories about life in an American city in the 21st C.  Each story involves 140 characters or less delivered––that is, “tweeted”––on Twitter over a 24 hr. period.  

Also via twitter ([@GilStudent](http://twitter.com/GilStudent/status/3293107995)), USA Today [reports briefly](http://www.usatoday.com/tech/webguide/internetlife/2009-08-12-literary-twitter_N.htm) on authors who tweet.
