Thanks to some fellow Odyssey graduates for pointing me to the latest Writers of the Future contest news.  The [first set of honorable mentions](http://wotfblog.blogspot.com/2010/03/1st-set-of-honorable-mentions-for-1st.html) for last quarter has been up [at the new location of the WotF blog](http://wotfblog.blogspot.com/) for a while now.  The [second set](http://wotfblog.blogspot.com/2010/03/2nd-set-of-honorable-mentions-for-1st.html) first appeared in a press release (~~http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/second-round-of-honorable-mentions,1211932.shtml~~) last week; yours truly was honorably mentioned.  The [semi-finalists and finalists](http://wotfblog.blogspot.com/2010/03/first-quarter-semi-finalists-and.html) came out yesterday in another press release (~~http://www.your-story.org/finalists-announced-in-1st-quarter-2010-of-l-ron-hubbards-international-contest-for-writers-153490/~~).
