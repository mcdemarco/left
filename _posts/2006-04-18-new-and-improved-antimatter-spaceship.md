Via [GeekPress](http://www.geekpress.com/2006/04/new-and-improved-antimatter-spaceship.html):   PhysOrg.com reports on a [new and improved antimatter spaceship](http://www.physorg.com/news64499584.html) (re)designed by the NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts (NIAC).

> Previous antimatter-powered spaceship designs employed antiprotons, which produce high-energy gamma rays when they annihilate. The new design will use positrons, which make gamma rays with about 400 times less energy.
> 
> The NIAC research is a preliminary study to see if the idea is feasible.
