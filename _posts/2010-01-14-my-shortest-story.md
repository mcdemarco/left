[My shortest story](http://twitter.com/thaumatrope/status/7756631121) yet was published today at [Thaumatrope](http://thaumatrope.greententacles.com/), an sf/f/h twitter fiction magazine.  I dimly recall submitting it, apparently in response to a call for steampunk and/or holiday stories, but I figured [Bad Elf](http://thaumatrope.greententacles.com/serials/BadElf/) had killed little Timmy and buried his body in the slush pile.

To [submit](http://thaumatrope.greententacles.com/submissions/stories/) your own 140 characters of immortal speculative prose, all you need is a twitter account.
