Via [Dean Wesley Smith's site](http://www.deanwesleysmith.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=65):  The International Association of Media Tie-In Writers, or [IAMTW](http://www.iamtw.org/), is a new professional organization.

> The IAMTW is dedicated to enhancing the professional and public image of tie-in writers...to working with the media to review tie-in novels and publicize their authors...to educating people about who we are and what we do....and to providing a forum for tie-in writers to share information, support one another, and discuss issues relating to our field (via a monthly e-newsletter, our website, and our active yahoo discussion group).
