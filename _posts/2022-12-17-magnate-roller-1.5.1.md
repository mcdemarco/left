[Magnate Roller](/games/decktet/magnate/) has been brushed up to version 1.5.1.  The occasion of the update was my trying out the [revised solo rules](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2332690/article/33719379#33719379) and having to roll an actual die to place the automaton's cards.  Now the roller can do that part, too.

I recommend leaving the courts out for the solo game.  Without an opponent rolling, there never seem to be enough resources to build them, and they end up both clogging your hand and making the automaton impossible to beat.
