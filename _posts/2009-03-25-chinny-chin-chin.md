Via [the Double-Tongued Dictionary](http://www.doubletongued.org/): Lexicographer Grant Barrett contemplates [children's nursery rhymes](http://www.doubletongued.org/index.php/grantbarrett/the_lore_and_rhymes_of_children/).  Here, for example, is the truth about the Three Little Pigs:

> I do recall most of ‘The Three Little Pigs’. There are three pigs, and a wolf who is trying to get inside their houses, and in response to his demands, the pigs say the memorable phrase, “Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin.”<!--break-->
>
> This is partly a nonsense phrase, of course. That jutting feature of the face just below the mouth doesn’t need the “chinny chin”. So why do we add the extra words?
>
> Well, in a version of the story that predates the version we usually tell today, the pigs were goats. Although pigs do have whiskers of a sort, goats have beards, which makes more sense.
