Via [io9](http://io9.com/5182800/pry-open-your-own-head-with-ted-chiangs-exhalation):  [Night Shade Books](http://www.nightshadebooks.com/2009/03/24/ted-chiangs-exhalation-now-available-for-download/) put Ted Chiang's Hugo-nominated short story "Exhalation" online in various formats.

> It has long been said that air (which others call argon) is the source of life. This is not in fact the case, and I engrave these words to describe how I came to understand the true source of life and, as a corollary, the means by which life will one day end.

### Update

"Exhalation" is 404 at Nightshade Books but is currently available online at [Lightspeed Magazine](http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/exhalation/).
