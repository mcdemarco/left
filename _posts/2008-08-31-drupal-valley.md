The site was down for about 20 minutes for a [Drupal](http://drupal.org/) [upgrade](http://drupal.org/drupal-6.4).  The management apologizes for any inconvenience.  <!--break-->Drupal is a massive CMS with [odd, hard-coded defaults](http://drupal.org/node/118901), [picayune system requirements](http://drupal.org/node/186668), and [freakish](http://drupal.org/node/273871) [bugs](http://drupal.org/node/82690), all of which I run into every time I try to upgrade.

I was going to give up my favorite Drupal feature, the [feed aggregator](/aggregator), this time and go with [Textpattern, a flexible, elegant, easy-to-use content management system](http://textpattern.com/).  I would certainly recommend it to anyone starting from scratch, but I wouldn't try to migrate even a simple [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) blog to Textpattern, never mind a whole Drupal database.

Yes, I *could* write enough SQL to make it happen, but I'd rather not.  Drupal is like Serenity Valley (or the Hotel California, for the mundanes in the audience); you can never leave.
