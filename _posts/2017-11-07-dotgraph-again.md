[DotGraph](/tools/scree/dotgraph/) got another little bug fix today, for some mysterious loss-of-start-node behavior that My Assiduous User may or may not have experienced, and that I discovered while mapping a CYOA book for fun.

Version 2.0.5 was actually intended to allow use of the last tag rather than the first tag for coloration, as mentioned in [my previous point release post](/blog/2017/10/31/dotgraph/), and it does that, too, though my NaNoWriMo story hasn't gotten quite out of hand enough yet for that feature to have gotten a thorough testing.  YMMV.
