Via [plime](http://www.plime.com/science/l/71615/1/):  [Discovery News reports](http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2008/08/07/neanderthal-dna.html) on the successful sequencing of Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA.  Neanderthal Park is not far behind:

> Geneticist David Reich at the Harvard Medical School also agrees that the newly sequenced genome "is exciting and important."
>
> "The most striking thing about the paper is that it shows that the authors are able to get an extremely reliable DNA sequence out of a (38,000-year-old) Neanderthal fossil especially when they do a large amount of DNA sequencing," Reich told Discovery News, mentioning that it then "becomes obvious that the sequence the authors are obtaining is correct."
>
> Green and his team are already at work on yet another Neanderthal genome project --- sequencing the complete Neanderthal nuclear genome --- that should be finished by the end of the year. It should answer, once and for all, whether or not modern humans and Neanderthals interbred to such a degree that the mixing would have resulted in a Neanderthal genetic contribution to the modern human gene pool.
