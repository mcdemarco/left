On the Spore watch, Jason Henninger at Tor.com [discusses his losing battles with enemy microbes](http://www.tor.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=blog&id=7419) in the game of evolution:

> I’ve had a blast running around, picking stuff up, fighting or befriending other races.
>
> Getting eaten by new and interesting beings.
>
> Getting ganked every time I leave the village.
>
> Oh sure. It’s grand. I’ve never had so much fun being on the receiving end of perpetual genocide.
