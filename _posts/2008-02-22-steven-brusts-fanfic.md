Via [FireflyFans.net](http://fireflyfans.net/mthread.aspx?bid=2&tid=32550&p=1):  Steven Brust has braved the lawyers to post his free Firefly novel, [My Own Kind of Freedom](http://dreamcafe.com/firefly.html), online.  You can find some details in his [livejournal](http://skzbrust.livejournal.com/) or [group blog](http://dreamcafe.com/words/2008/02/05/firefly-novel/), and a positive review at [io9](http://io9.com/353893/firefly-novel-from-steven-brust-is-action-packed-and-fun).<!--break-->

I did some digging to find out when the novel is set (a piece of information most fanfic writers would have put right up front):  between the TV series and the movie.
