Via del.icio.us:  [The Boston Globe](http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/08/05/qa_doris_lessing/?page=full) has an interview with Doris Lessing, in which she discusses her new novel, *The Cleft*, and why she'll never win the Nobel prize:

> IDEAS: Why do you think you haven't won a Nobel Prize?
>
> LESSING: There is something hidden here.<!--break--> At a big evening party in Sweden, back when my Swedish publisher was alive, a little gray chap from the Nobel Committee sat down beside me and said: "You'll never win the Nobel Prize. We don't like you."
>
> It was so graceless. What was I to say? I didn't say anything. I've never found out why they don't like me.
