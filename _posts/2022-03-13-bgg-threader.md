I recently made a [BoardGameGeek thread formatter](/games/bgg/thread.html) along the lines of my [BoardGameGeek sorters](/games/bgg/).  It's intended mainly to nicely format game FAQs that appear in the forums rather than in the wiki, but it will handle any thread to the extent that the BoardGameGeek API handles it.  A few more details are available [here](/games/bgg/#FAQs.and.Threads).
