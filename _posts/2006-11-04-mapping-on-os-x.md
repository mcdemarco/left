Someone in the [NaNoWriMo tech forum](http://www.nanowrimo.org/modules/newbb/viewforum.php?forum=157) asked about [freeware for making a town in OS X](http://www.nanowrimo.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=17718&start=0#forumpost285241).  Having a thousand words yet to write tonight, of course I went googling.

As I suspected, there are still no good free gaming-style mapping programs for OS X, but I did find the shareware [RPGMapMaker](http://fmteau.club.fr/rpgmapmaker/rpgmapmaker.htm) and a demo of [Dundjinni](http://www.dundjinni.com/). <!--break-->
But Maldin recommends that you [do it by hand instead](http://melkot.com/mechanics/map-guide.html).

You can also do it online with  [Benny's Dungeon Map Maker](http://www.sev.org/members/bmazur/dndminis/dmm.html) or the [Stonesword](http://www.stonesword.com/)  Dungeon Maker and World Maker.  If you want the map made for you, [Gozzy's](http://www.gozzys.com/) has great random map generators.
