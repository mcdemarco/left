> As regulars know, we're currently looking at query letters authors have sent, or were considering sending. Evil Editor's goal is to get more editors to request more manuscripts, thus increasing the income of the U.S. Postal Service, thus delaying the inevitable raising of the price of a stamp to 41 cents.  <!--break--> True, all these extra manuscripts being printed will necessitate the destruction of another rain forest or two, but these two cent increases every couple years are mildly annoying to Evil Editor.

 **Warning:**  not beverage-safe.
