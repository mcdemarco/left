 I'm inventing a language for my NaNoWriMo novel---preferably a wordy one.  For help generating lots of placeholding gibberish until December 1st, I may try the [Conlang Word Maker](http://www.fantasist.net/wordmaker.shtml).  But since I'm starting from a known language, maybe I'll use the [Custom Word Generator](http://www.fantasist.net/wordgen2.shtml) or adapt one of [Chris Pound's language machines](http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~pound/).
