Via [Futurismic](http://futurismic.com/2008/12/16/us-government-refuses-support-for-tubes-in-1908/):  a hundred years ago last month, [the New York Times reported](http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=2&res=980CE5DC113EE233A25755C1A9649D946997D6CF) that the Postmaster General would not be buying up local [pneumatic tube](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumatic_tube) systems for the transport of the mail.<!--break-->

I could never resist a pneumatic tube.  For more about pneumatic tubes in fiction, [see the Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumatic_tube#In_fiction).
