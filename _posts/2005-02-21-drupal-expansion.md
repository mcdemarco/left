Tweaking my website is not nearly as important to my writing career as, say, actually *writing*; nevertheless, tweak happens.  I'd been meaning to expand my use of Drupal on the site ever since I installed it in a corner directory to replace the infinitely geeky but not-so-user-friendly Blosxom.  What pushed me over the edge today was Google.

When I google myself, I get another M. C. DeMarco, some pages that link to here, and one or two of my old sites.  This domain shows up, too, but without a nice description or any indication that I'm the real M. C. DeMarco.  I think the problem is my gorgeous but content-free [splash page](/index.html).  I could have figured out the Google algorithm of the moment and tweaked my meta tags to suit, but deep in my heart I knew splash pages were the adverbs of the web world:  it had to go.

So now it's gone, and the main drupal page has taken its place.  I also added navigation improvements like search, a link to my kind hosts, pretty feed buttons (from [Taylor McKnight's collection](http://www.gtmcknight.com/buttons/feeds.php) and [Adam Kalsey's button maker](http://kalsey.com/tools/buttonmaker/)), and some under-the-hood stuff like email notifications.  Still to come is a pegged site-mission-style entry, or the built-in Drupal site mission blurbifier.  [It should be up on the [front page](/) now.]
