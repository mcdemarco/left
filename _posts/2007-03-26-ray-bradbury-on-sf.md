Via [del.icio.us sf](http://del.icio.us/tag/science%2Bfiction), a link to the SciFi Channel's [interview with Ray Bradbury](http://www.scifi.com/sfw/interviews/sfw15376.html) and a quote picked up by the tagger:

> "I've only written one science-fiction book; that is Fahrenheit 451. All the others are fantasies and horror." There's one for the definitionists to debate.<!--break-->

Here's a more interesting quote about the divided writing life:

>  I live in the body with Ray Bradbury. There are two of me, the one that writes and the one who watches him write. I take credit for what Ray Bradbury does. I am not him, and he is not me. There are two of me here; the one that writes and the one that watches.
