Doris Lessing's comments on winning the Nobel Prize have been immortalized, until Reuters complains, on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuBODHFBZ8k).  The short version, ["Oh Christ"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_qyvU6_7nE), will probably stay up longer.  Thanks to [David Baddiel](http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article2693740.ece) for the heads-up.
