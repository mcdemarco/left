Via [SFScope](http://sfscope.com/2009/01/new-unpublished-tolkien-book-c/):  HarperCollins is [apparently publishing](https://web.archive.org/web/20090430090505/http://www.thebookseller.com/news/73781-new-tolkien-for-harpercollins.html) another lost Tolkien work this coming May.  This one is not his own fantasy, although it is once again edited by Christopher Tolkien:

> The publication will make available for the first time Tolkien’s extensive retelling in English narrative verse of the epic Norse tales of Sigurd the Völsung and the Fall of the Niflungs. <!--break-->
>
> Christopher Tolkien edited Tolkien's most recent title *The Children of Húrin* in 2007.

I confess I bought *The Children of Húrin* (remaindered), but haven't read it yet.
