 There are plenty of free on-line dictionaries and thesauri out there, but the selection is limited once you go off-line. [WordNet](http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/) is an interesting variation on the thesaurus theme.  You can get a [MacOS X package](http://wordnet.sourceforge.net/) from Sourceforge.

[JDict](http://jdict.sourceforge.net/), is a dict-protocol dictionary server you can run locally for your own use.  The easiest way to install JDict on MacOS X is with [DICTatoro](http://www.ropersonline.com/dict/). The standard interface is a local web page, but the Mac version also includes a special configuration of [OmniDictionary](http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnidictionary/) and a nice selection of free dictionaries.
