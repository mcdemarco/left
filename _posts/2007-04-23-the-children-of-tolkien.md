<em>The Children of Hurin</em> is out, and Amazon has <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/?docId=1000074611">a review by Christopher Tolkien's son Adam</a>:

<blockquote>Remarkably, considering that the earliest passages in <i>The Children of H&uacute;rin</i> are 90 years old, Christopher's reworking of the book works brilliantly.<!--break-->  In a sense it is not a new book, for versions and pieces of the story will be familiar to some readers. For example, the whole tale was condensed down into a single chapter in <i>The Silmarillion</i>, as was the story of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> at the end of that book, so what you have here is the reconstructed version, complete with familiar elements and also passages that have never appeared before. (It might be compared to a sort of literary Director's Cut, the long version of the story assembled from all the best footage available, though my father probably wouldn't welcome the filmmaking comparison!)</blockquote>
