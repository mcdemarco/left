At [io9](http://io9.com/5326651/the-memory-of-feeling-is-not-feeling-memory-sticks-explores-human-computers),  a book review of *Memory Sticks* by Wood Ingham:

> A few months ago, Wood Ingham joined with authors Will Hindmarch and Chuck Wendig, to form an on-line writer's collective known as Jet-Pack. Although initially connected by their work for RPG publisher White Wolf, the three authors' flash fiction and short stories revealed a series of off-kilter realities and glossy dystopian futures. Ingham's Memory Sticks originally appeared on Jet-Pack as a serialized story about a young woman, named Sarah whose transient memories seem largely dictated by the implanted computer that sometimes controls her brain. Collected into novella form, it becomes a meditation on the line between technology and humanity, and what happens when the line becomes far too blurred.
