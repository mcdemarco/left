Via a mailing list:  [BoingBoing](http://www.boingboing.net/2008/08/26/science-of-star-wars.html) reposts a brief excerpt from *The Science of Star Wars* by Jeanne Cavelos, my teacher from [Odyssey](http://www.sff.net/odyssey/).

> Thus it seems the lasers we have today would be capable of doing many of the things we see in Star Wars. We could injure or kill people; we could burn structures or melt holes in walls; we could destroy targeted areas of spaceships, assuming we could keep a beam on them for long enough. The main difference between Star Wars lasers and ours is the size.<!--break--> While we can create lasers that emit extremely powerful energies, we need to pump great energies into them to make them work.
