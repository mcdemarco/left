Via [GeekPress](http://www.geekpress.com/2006/09/what-are-dark-matter-and-dark-energy.html):  National Geographic News reports on [Dark Matter's Rival: Ether Theory Challenges "Invisible Mass"](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/09/060908-dark-matter.html).  It sounds like sarcasm but it's serious:

> Starkman's controversial counterproposal is that the presence of ether in the universe better explains the galaxies' behavior.
> 
> His theories were recently reported in the August 26 issue of New Scientist magazine.
> 
> "Galaxies spin faster than they should, given the amount of matter we see in them. The possibility we've gone with for a long time is that there's some unaccounted-for mass generating that extra gravity," Starkman said.
> 
> "But the other possibility is that the amount of mass we see generates more gravity than we thought. That's where ether comes in."
