Michael Burstein has [two](http://mabfan.livejournal.com/438840.html) [posts](http://mabfan.livejournal.com/439299.html) up about "the value of our work" and the tendency of people to ask writers to give away their writing or their time for free.  I sometimes get asked to write for free (both fiction and non-fiction), though no one ever asks me to test their software for free.  It is surprisingly difficult to convey the notion that I write for *money*; fortunately now I can just point them to Michael's free posts...
