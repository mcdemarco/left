A reference on a mailing list to Kristine Kathryn Rusch's original argument made me realize I never linked it.  So here it is, [Barbarian Confessions](http://www.asimovs.com/_issue_0612/thoughtexperiments.shtml):

Sixteen years old when the movie came out, at a first-night screening with a dozen of my high school buddies, I watched the world change right in front of me. Did I know that E.E. "Doc"¬ù Smith had done something similar thirty years before? Of course not. <!--break--> My small town library never had that kind of trash (their words, not mine). Had I memorized the science fiction canon? Hell, I didn't even know there was such a thing as science fiction. Or fantasy. Or genre, for that matter.

I suppose I'm also a member of the Star Wars generation and media has often been my gateway drug to science fiction, but then there can't be many old fans still on the convention circle who were not, at the very least, part of the original Star Trek generation and who haven't read at least a few Star Trek tie-in novels (_back when they were good_, which is just to say, _back when_ I _read them_).

Lumping in fantasy with the disreputable sci-fi "trash" muddies the waters in more ways than one.  Fantasy was allowed, even encouraged, in the children's book sections of my youth.  We had no movies, unless you count those horrid old cartoons of Tolkien, but we had the literary respectability of Newbery medals.  Adult fantasy may be slumming with the space operas, but children's fantasy has always been mainstream.
