I was hoping the rumors weren't true, but [SFWA](http://www.sfwa.org/news/2006/obutler.htm) confirms that Octavia Butler died Saturday.  Thanks to [araken](http://araken.livejournal.com/) for the link.  [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octavia_Butler) is already updated; you can find a list of her work there and links to two short stories at SciFi.com.
