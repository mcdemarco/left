Via [Jenny Williams on twitter](http://twitter.com/jennywilliams/status/3758195538):  Shelfari has a virtual spread of [Neil Gaiman's bookshelves](http://blog.shelfari.com/my_weblog/2009/09/neil.html).

> Naturally we’d assumed that someone whose work is filled with references ranging from literary to mythological would have a fairly extensive library but even so, we were a bit unprepared for the scope of what he sent us.  In the basement of his house of secrets we find a room that’s wall-to-wall and floor-to-ceiling with books (along with a scattering of awards, gargoyles and felines).

Shelfari is also [on twitter now](http://blog.shelfari.com/my_weblog/2009/09/shelfari-is-twittering.html), and planning to tweet amusing 140-character book synopses.
