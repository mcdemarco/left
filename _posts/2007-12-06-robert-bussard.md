Via a mailing list:  [The Santa Fe New Mexican's obituary](http://www.santafenewmexican.com/SantaFeNorthernNM/Robert_Bussard__1928_2007_Physicist_known_for_pursuits_into_fus)  for Robert Bussard (father of the Bussard Ramjet), who passed away this October, focuses on his work with the Tokamak and Polywell:

> Bussard's idea is to convert hydrogen and boron, a widely available material, directly into electricity, producing helium as the only waste product.
>
> Two years ago, just as his federal funding was running out, Bussard believed he had achieved a "breakthrough."<!--break-->
>
> According to Bussard, data collected during experiments in the fall of 2005 by scientists from his company, Energy Matter Conversion Corp. (EMC2), suggest they had developed a fusion process that was 100,000 times more efficient than previous designs.
>
> The device they were using was the latest version of the Polywell, conceived in 1983 by Bussard and tested with funding from the U.S. Navy.
