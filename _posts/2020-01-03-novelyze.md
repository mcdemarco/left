Via [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/interactivefiction/comments/eixhns/new_interactive_fiction_platform_novelyze/): a new hyperfiction platform, [Novelyze](http://web.archive.org/web/20200930083850/https://novelyze.com/), is in a beta state of some sort suspiciously like [the old closed beta](http://web.archive.org/web/20181130032255/https://www.decisionfiction.com/) of Decision Fiction, before [their website](http://web.archive.org/web/20191220030942/https://www.decisionfiction.com) got even less informative.  The (new?) name is also unfortunately similar to [Novelize](https://www.getnovelize.com), a Scrivener-like subscription-based online writing app.

### Update

Novelize didn't last the year.
