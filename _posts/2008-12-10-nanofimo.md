It's not too late to sign up for [NaNoFiMo](http://web.archive.org/web/20180327163337/http://nanofimo.net), the sequel to NaNoWriMo.  If I thought 30,000 more ill-planned words would cure the problems of my first 50,000, I'd sign up now---or at least go a few rounds in [Write or Die](https://writeordie.com).<!--break-->

I haven't been feeding my House addiction either, except with [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjBdVYG9ms) (via [GeekPress](http://www.geekpress.com/2008/11/video-of-day-hugh-laurie-sings-my-kind.html)).
