[SciFi.com reports](http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=3&id=55911) about the light and fluffy B-movie content of M. Night Shyamalan's *The Happening*, which opens today:

> "One of the things that I said to everybody--the cast and crew--I said, 'This is a B movie,'" Shyamalan said in a press conference in New York on June 9. "Let's get ourselves straight here. This is just a great B movie. We're making the best B movie we can here. That's our job. We're making a B movie.<!--break--> If the themes of the movie have something that stick with you, great. Great. But we're not going to put that in front of the movie."
