Via  [GeekPress](http://www.geekpress.com/2006/11/damascus-steel-swords-may-owe-their.html):  Nature reports on [carbon nanotubes in Damascus steel](http://www.nature.com/news/2006/061113/full/061113-11.html).

> Sabres from Damascus, now in Syria, date back as far as 900 AD. Strong and sharp, they are made from a type of steel called wootz.
>
> Their blades bear a banded pattern thought to have been created as the sword was annealed and forged. But the secret of the swords' manufacture was lost in the eighteenth century.<!--break-->
>
> Materials researcher Peter Paufler and his colleagues at Dresden University, Germany, have taken electron-microscope pictures of the swords and found that wootz has a microstructure of nano-metre-sized tubes, just like carbon nanotubes used in modern technologies for their lightweight strength.
