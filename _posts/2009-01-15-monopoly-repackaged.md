Via [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2008/12/22/monopoly-repackaging):  last month Andy Mangold posted a beautiful [Monopoly Repackaging](http://www.andymangold.com/monopoly-repackaging/) mockup.  Commenters, apparently unaware that *repackaging* involves only the *packaging*, asked where the new board was and suggested using the [Helvetica Monopoly board](http://www.zukunft.fr/pagehelvet.htm).<!--break-->

For full game redesigns, I recommend [Mike Doyle's Art Play](http://mdoyle.blogspot.com/).  Posts are infrequent and he's never done Monopoly, but [his art gallery](http://mdoyle2.blogspot.com/) is filled with gorgeous redesigned boards, cards, pieces, and, of course, packaging.
