My progress through *The Two Towers* has been slow.  Gimli had a nice moment in the Glittering Caves of Aglarond, but for quotable material I had to wait for Frodo to reach the Black Gate in book IV:

> Sam said nothing. The look on Frodo's face was enough for him; he knew that words of his were useless. And after all he never had any real hope in the affair from the beginning; but being a cheerful hobbit he had not needed hope, as long as despair could be postponed.

Thanks to [Reading *Lord of the Rings*](http://www.electricpenguin.com/blatherings/lotr/archives/00000039.html) for typing up the quote, almost correctly.  I peeked ahead, and Debbie did make it all the way through the books to the Grey Havens.
