We're headed to LoneStarCon 3 early on Tuesday because we're on tech staff.  Before we go, though, I wanted to put up my latest project ([paste-app.net](http://paste-app.net)) on my husband's hosting service, and that was a good opportunity to move the blog there, too.  If you can see this post, I've managed to move house.
