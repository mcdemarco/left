I saw [Refusenik](http://refusenikmovie.com/) tonight at the [Kendall Square Cinema](http://www.landmarktheatres.com/Films/films_frameset.asp?id=67092), and producer Laura Bialis also spoke afterwards about how the refuseniks' story inevitably took over the movie from her original subject:  protesters outside the Soviet Union.

> *REFUSENIK* is the first retrospective documentary to chronicle the thirty-year movement to free Soviet Jews. It shows how a small grassroots effort bold enough to take on a Cold War superpower blossomed into an international human rights campaign that engaged the disempowered and world leaders alike.<!--break--> Told through the eyes of activists on both sides of the Iron Curtain - many of whom survived punishment in Soviet Gulag labor camps - the film is a tapestry of first-person accounts of heroism, sacrifice, and ultimately, liberation.

> The campaign to free Soviet Jewry is a major event in Jewish history. By 1992, one and a half million Jews had left the Soviet Union to live in freedom as a direct result of what was likely the most successful human rights campaign of all times.
