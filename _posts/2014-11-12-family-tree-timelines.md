During NaNoWriMo 2013, I wrote a Random Family Tree Generator in order to auto-generate characters.  So far this NaNoWriMo, I've added a timeline view of the family tree.  I figured I'd throw it into [the demo](/tools/family-tree-generator/lineage.html) now (even though I'm sure more ~~cat-vacuuming~~ tinkering is in store for it), just in case someone else also needs to know at a glance whether so-and-so's automatically generated great-grandparent is still alive at the time of their novel.
