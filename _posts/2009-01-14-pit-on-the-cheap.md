Yehuda has [easy instructions](http://jergames.blogspot.com/2009/01/wielding-decks-1-pit.html) for playing the classic stock trading card game [Pit](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/140) on the cheap with just two decks of regular playing cards.  This was the first installment of his [new series](http://jergames.blogspot.com/search/label/wielding%20the%20decks) on games you can play with regular cards.<!--break-->

Although Pit is already pretty cheap and easy, using regular cards may be more convenient for an impromptu game.  On the other hand, installment #2, [Power Grid](http://jergames.blogspot.com/2009/01/wielding-decks-2-power-grid.html), looks too complicated.  I've played the real game and I still couldn't follow the cheap-version instructions.  I'm still looking forward to the rest of the series, though.
