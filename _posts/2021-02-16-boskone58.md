[Boskone](http://www.boskone.org/), New England's longest-running science fiction and fantasy convention, went online this past weekend.  Many panels were recorded, so it's not too late to catch up on large swathes of the con that I managed to miss while hanging out in the gaming zoom.  Next year in the Westin!
