I used DotGraph during [this NaNoWriMo](/blog/2017/11/30/nanowrimo-2017/), and besides my intermittent minor updates (to [2.0.5](/blog/2017/11/07/dotgraph-again/) and [2.0.6](/blog/2017/11/14/dotgraph-again-again/)), I made some semi-major changes now dubbed [DotGraph 2.1.0](/tools/scree/dotgraph/).  The new version lets you trace a word or phrase though your story, and also lets you pass your desired DotGraph settings in using the StorySettings special passage.
