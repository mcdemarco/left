There are two outlining weeks left until [NaNoWriMo](http://www.nanowrimo.org/).  National Novel Writing Month is in its eighth year; you can read the whole sordid history [here](http://www.nanowrimo.org/modules/cjaycontent/index.php?id=4).  You can track my erratic progress [here](http://www.nanowrimo.org/userinfo.php?uid=4573) starting November 1st.
