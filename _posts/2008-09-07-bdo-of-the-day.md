Via [deli.cio.us](/aggregator/sources/24):  in his [blog entry of new, post-Singularity ideas](http://www.rudyrucker.com/blog/2008/08/25/fresh-sf-futures/), Rudy Rucker describes a variant of the [Alderson disk](http://www.mcdemarco.net/node/329).  Here's his even bigger Big Dumb Object:

> What if Earth were an endless flat plane, and you could walk (or fly your electric glider) forever in a straight line and never come back to where you started?<!--break--> The cockroach zone! The kingdom of the two-headed men! One night thereâ€™ll be a rumble and, wow, our little planet will have unrolled, ready for you to start out on the ultimate On the Road adventure.

I know it's [a sign science fiction is dying](/node/474) that I'm tempted to say that this infinite flat earth, like many of his other fresh ideas, is not science fiction at all.  It's more of a [planetary romance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_romance) on an infinite backdrop; it's science fantasy.
