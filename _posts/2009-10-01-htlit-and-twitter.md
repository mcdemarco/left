Via twitter:  the new [HTLit blog](http://htlit.com/) seems to be a handy clearinghouse for information about "literary hypertext."  It is itself [on twitter](http://twitter.com/htlit); hypertext has always been a high-tech genre so nobody in the community is complaining about how pointless or incomprehensible twitter is.<!--break-->  

My gradual move to twitter as an RSS reader has recently expanded to include my language feeds, [@schottsvocab](http://twitter.com/schottsvocab) and [@languagelog](http://twitter.com/languagelog), among others.
