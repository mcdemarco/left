As part of being back on the wagon, I wrote a new story this week and submitted it to [Writers of the Future](http://www.writersofthefuture.com/)---at 11:50pm Thursday night, thanks to their new online submissions policy.  Today I finally got around to logging it and my NaNoWriMo novel in my giant writing spreadsheet, and I noticed that I'd gone over the million word mark back on November 30th.  Since I started writing in the summer of 2001, I also managed to do the whole thing in just under 10 years.  (For the significance of these numbers, see my post on [10 Years or 1,000,000 Words](/node/259).)

I wouldn't say that this week's story was my best work or that it subtly displayed every one of my million words of practice, but I did bang it out surprisingly quickly; it only took one evening (Wednesday) out of my active social schedule.  It's also my third story in that particular universe, so I think once it's been rejected a few times I might package it up with the other two for sale.
