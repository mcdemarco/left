I've updated [Scree3](/tools/scree/), my Scrivener 3 template for writing hyperfiction with [Twine](/tools/twine.html)/Twee, to handle internal document links.  That way you can auto-create scenes just by linking them (as in the Twine GUI), and also zip around your scenes within Scrivener by clicking the links.  The new version number is 3.0.3a.

Scrivener 3 is still Mac-only at the moment, with the usual free 30-day-total trial for new and Scrivener 2 users.
