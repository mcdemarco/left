Via [SFScope](http://sfscope.com/2008/08/night-shade-briefly-reading-un.html):  Night Shade Books is [seeking zombie novels](http://jlassen.livejournal.com/597517.html) by October 31st.  Fortunately I have one right here...<!--break-->in my head, that I was hoping to write up for National Novel Writing Month.  

I think September has just been declared National Zombie Novel Writing Month.
