I changed the way I make some [recipe indices](/recipes/indices/) for my cookbook so that it's easier to add them; see, for example, my [Thanksgiving recipes](/recipes/indices/thanksgiving.html), by sort-of solving the general issue of tagging my recipes that's been bothering me for a while.  To do so, I followed some [advice](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50783136) about adding metadata to markdown without YAML by using link references instead.  You can read more about it in one of the [READMEs](https://github.com/mcdemarco/the-new-kitchen-cookbook/blob/master/_contents/README.md) at my repository.
