Via [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/08/07/vacation):  John Hughes on how he wrote Vacation '58, the predecessor to National Lampoon's Vacation is available in [a Zoetrope back issue](http://www.all-story.com/issues.cgi?action=show_story&story_id=389).  Here's how he found time to write:

> Like many other copywriters at the agency, I was working at home at night and on weekends. I was writing on the commuter train. I was also writing at work. Whenever I had to leave my office unattended, I stashed my magazine text in the wastebasket, covered it with my morning newspaper, dumped what was left in my coffee cup on it, and emptied my ashtray over the whole mess. At the end of the day, I put it in a Leo Burnett Co. interoffice envelope, took it home, cleaned it off, and transcribed it.
