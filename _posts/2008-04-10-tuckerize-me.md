Via [UniversalHub](http://www.universalhub.com/node/13877):   Michael Burstein is [having a contest](http://mabfan.livejournal.com/369030.html) for people who preorder his new short story collection.  Winners will be Tuckerized at a later date.<!--break-->

> But second, we decided to sweeten the pot a little for those of you willing to step up to the plate early and order a hardcover copy of the book. And so we are announcing the "I Remember the Future" Tuckerization contest.
>
> Everyone who pre-orders a hardcover copy of the book by June 15 will be entered into a raffle. Two lucky winners will have their names used as names of characters in the two new stories, "Empty Spaces" and "I Remember the Future."
