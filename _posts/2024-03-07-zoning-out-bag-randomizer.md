I've added pyramid randomization to the [Zoning Out Randomizer](https://mcdemarco.github.io/321/zoningoutrandomizer.html), because it turns out it's pretty annoying to draw pyramids by size from only one bag, and I was jealous of the [Solomids randomizer](https://dazeysan.github.io/Solomids/SolomidsRandomSetup.html).  I also relaxed the restrictions on game size (previously to just the regular game and the small city variant) so it's easier to set up Samantha's toddler games with only one special rule.

I thought about adding a random seed to share challenges like the [Solomids people do](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/347606/solomids/forums/194), but it seemed unlikely to get much use.
