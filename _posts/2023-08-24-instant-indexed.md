I added an [Instant Pot recipe index](/recipes/ipIndex.html) to my cookbook, since summertime calls for lots of quick, oven-free recipes without the need to defrost ahead of time, and it's not obvious from the full [table of contents](/recipes/) that some of my regular recipes also include Instant Pot directions.

I haven't solved the general issue of tagging my recipes; instead I added a flag to the YAML index I use to generate the [table of contents](/recipes/) and added a page to render the Instant Pot index with Jekyll.
