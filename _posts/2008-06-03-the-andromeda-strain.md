Not every movie can star [Natan Sharansky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natan_Sharansky), but The Andromeda Strain was an exceptional disappointment.  Blogcritics Magazine has [a negative review](http://blogcritics.org/archives/2008/05/30/180556.php) that touches briefly on the movie's major weakness:  poor technobabble.

> Since the scientists actually do very little science, the script pads out the running time with plenty of pseudo-science, giving every actor a chance to graft on some ludicrous exposition without actually explaining a thing.
