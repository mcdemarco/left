Via [@Scrivener](http://twitter.com/ScrivenerApp/status/5366559303):  Alexandra Sokoloff's [blog](http://thedarksalon.blogspot.com/) is full of plot advice for NaNoWriMo taken from the silver screen.  See especially her [story elements checklist](http://thedarksalon.blogspot.com/2009/10/story-elements-checklist-for.html).  I wish I'd known about her October Outline month back in October.
