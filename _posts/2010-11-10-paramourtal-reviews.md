A few sites now have reviews of *Paramourtal* up.  [The Paranormal Romance Guild](http://www.paranormalromanceguild.com/booksonreview2010.htm#659830717) gives my story ("Sympathy From the Devil") 5 stars and calls it a "[f]un tale with a funny ending."  [Clara Hanoux](http://clarahanoux.blogspot.com/search/label/review) summarizes it as ["cute"](http://clarahanoux.blogspot.com/2010/11/review-sympathy-from-devil-by-m-c.html) and says, "This might just be the best story of the anthology!"<!--break-->

Editor Kevin Hosey is collecting reviews at [the Cliffhanger Books site](http://www.cliffhangerbooks.com/reviews.html), selling merchandise at [CafePress](http://www.cafepress.com/CliffhangerBooks), and also planning a book signing in Dallas on January 22nd.
