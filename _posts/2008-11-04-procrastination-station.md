My own personal NaNoWriMo [procrastination station](http://www.nanowrimo.org/taxonomy/term/112) is [iDrops](http://www.idropsgame.com/), an online/iPod/iPhone version of the classic [SameGame](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SameGame).  Despite much dropping of blocks, I still hit my goal of 2,000 words last night, for 6,000 total.<!--break-->

Unfortunately the [search page](http://www.nanowrimo.org/eng/search/search_wrimo) is still down, so I can't find writing buddies I know are participating in order to add them to [my buddylist](http://nanowrimo.org/participants/mcd/buddies).
