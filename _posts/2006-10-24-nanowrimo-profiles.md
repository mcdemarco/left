I noticed that <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/userinfo.php?uid=102616">araken</a> had a picture of himself in his profile, so I had to <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/userinfo.php?uid=4573">get one too</a>.  

Other profiles of note include <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/userinfo.php?uid=1">Mystery Member #1</a>,  <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/userinfo.php?uid=5">Member #5: Marrije</a>, the first human member, <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/userinfo.php?uid=301">Chris Baty</a>, the man who started it all, and <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/userinfo.php?uid=36949">Lani Diane Rich</a>, one of the first published NaNo novelists.
