Via [SFScope](http://sfscope.com/2009/02/william-shunns-flog-to-discuss.html):  I'm much more excited than you will likely be about a new blog, William Shunn's [Flog:  Notes on Manuscript Formatting for Fiction Writers](http://www.shunn.net/format/).  He says:

> For well over a decade my formatting guide "Proper Manuscript Format" has been available online, with the result that I've fielded hundreds of questions on the subject from writers around the English-speaking world. For years now I've wanted to share those letters and my responses to them online, on the theory that for every question I receive there are probably ten times as many writers with the same question who don't email and would find the discussion helpful.
