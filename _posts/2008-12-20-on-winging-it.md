A couple of weeks back at Tor.com, Jane Lindskold blogged about [Practical Mysticism](http://www.tor.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=blog&id=9638), the fine art of letting your muse do the plotting:

> I still recall how, after getting quite frustrated while working on *Changer*, a key element came clear when I decided I was getting nowhere and headed out the door for some exercise.
>
>I was two-tenths of a mile from my house when what had fought me at the keyboard came mysteriously clear.<!--break--> I was so thrilled, I had to force myself to finish my two and three-quarter mile ramble.
>
>I think my characters benefit from my reliance on my subconscious as well. I never create a character to simply serve as a victim or object lesson. (Yes. Sadly, there are many writers who do so.) I never force a romance, even when I think two characters are perfect for each other. If they donâ€™t agree, okay, I go down the more difficult road.
