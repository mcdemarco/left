There's been an unexpected development in the Slate Star Codex story (a.k.a., [The Tragedy of the Cancels](/blog/2020/06/23/tragedy-of-the-cancels/)) from a few weeks back.  The New Yorker scooped the still-unpublished New York Times article by publishing their own article about "Scott Alexander" and the Slate Star Codex community yesterday:  [Slate Star Codex and Silicon Valleyâ€™s War Against the Media:  How a controversial rationalist blogger became a mascot and martyr in a struggle against the New York Times](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-inquiry/slate-star-codex-and-silicon-valleys-war-against-the-media) by Gideon Lewis-Kraus.

Reactions from the Slate Star Codex community in exile at Reddit [were mostly positive](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/ho6g2b/slate_star_codex_and_silicon_valleys_war_against/), and it also made [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23781743), where the reaction was more mixed.  It's unclear whether the New York Times will continue with their doxxing plans, repudiate them, or never tell Scott Alexander that his pseudonymity is safe.
