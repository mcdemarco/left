I tried sharing my [Dutch Puff](/recipes/quick-bread/dutchPuff/) recipe and noticed how little metadata makes it through the process I use to convert my recipes into a [Jekyll collection](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/) despite their having no YAML headers.  I don't think I've ever blogged about the process, but it's adequately summarized in [this Github comment](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help/issues/223#issuecomment-308140360) I made to little effect once upon a time.

I didn't find a good solution or write the hacky script I will eventually need to slip in some YAML after checkout.  I did spruce up the menus and headers, added sub-tables of contents, and fixed some unrelated bugs I spotted in the meantime.  (If the site looks broken, it's probably a problem with cached CSS that can be cured by clearing your browser cache.)
