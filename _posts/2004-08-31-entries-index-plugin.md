 I've moved to a new hosting service.  To preserve the timestamps on my blog entries I installed the [entries_index plugin](http://www.blosxom.com/plugins/indexing/entries_index.htm) on my local version of the blog, indexed my entries (simply by opening the [2004](http://www.mcdemarco.net/blog/blosxom.cgi/2004) archive page), and then uploaded the plugin and the  `blosxom/plugins/state/.entries_index.index` file to the new server.

The [blosxom yahoo group](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/blosxom/) has an [RSS feed](http://rss.groups.yahoo.com/group/blosxom/rss).
