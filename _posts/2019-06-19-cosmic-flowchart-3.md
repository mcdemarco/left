In [Part I](/blog/2019/06/17/cosmic-flowchart/), I covered the fictional, meta-choicemaps shown in [Bandersnatch](https://www.netflix.com/title/80988062).  In [Part II](/blog/2019/06/18/cosmic-flowchart-2/), I covered some of the earlier and more popular actual maps of the show as played (and frequently mapped) by the viewers.  Here in Part III, I will survey the later and less noted maps of the show, in roughly chronological order.

In the December 28th thread about u/alpine-'s more popular graph, [u/turcois on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmirror/comments/aa9oym/almost_4_hours_after_release_and_i_think_i_have/ecq6wdr/) posted his simpler, boxy, top-to-bottom graph with color-coding for ends, repeating of passages, and randomized choices.  Also Jason Cooper, a.k.a. [deamwork at GitHub](https://github.com/deamwork/BlackMirror-BanderSnatch-Map), apparently translated alpine-'s map into [draw.io](https://www.draw.io) format and Chinese, with the intention of collaborative improvement (which doesn't seem to have panned out):

Also on December 28th, [Leon Hurley tweeted](https://twitter.com/LeonHurley/status/1078796394247393281) his meandering map, both shrunk down to spoiler-free size, and also in full resolution:

Some maps desperately need legends for their unexplained color coding.  On December 28th, [u/Madra_ruax on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmirror/comments/aahqbr/an_attempt_at_mapping_bandersnatch/) posted posted a flowchart with pervasive, but equally unexplained, color coding.  On December 29th, [u/EngineeringMySadness on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmirror/comments/aajk5r/full_bandersnatch_flowchart_all_branches_story/) posted a wordy, black-and-white looking flowchart that actually has some subtle line coloring:

On December 29th, Reza Lesmana posted a three-piece incomplete flowchart to [his blog](https://ramblingremarks.blogspot.com/2018/12/blackmirror-bandersnatch-flow-chart.html), and Wogan May [blogged](https://wogan.blog/2018/12/29/black-mirror-bandersnatch/) an excerpt of his unpublished flowchart:

On December 29th, Tobie, [@kubriickscube on Twitter](https://twitter.com/kubriickscube/status/1078932780233371648) tweeted an incomplete map in a thematic White Bear/video game crossover style.  (The color coding appears to be structural rather than reflecting [the similar colors of the show](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bandersnatch/comments/ac75lq/this_is_my_favorite_find_so_far_over_and_over/).)  On January 1st, [u/AppiusClaudius on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmirror/comments/abgbvj/bandersnatch_decision_flowchart_spoilers/) joined in the dark theme with a black, bubbly, partial map, with some boldface for end nodes and a single, unexplained octagon shaped node:

On December 30th, [u/pablo_alab on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmirror/comments/aatz76/a_bandersnatch_flowchart_i_made_i_cant_even_go/) posted an annotated, colorful map with ten numbered endings.  (The discussion on the post goes into up to 17 possible endings, the difficulties of mapping the PAC/PAX/JFD/TOY point, and the general feasibility of mapping Bandersnatch.)  In a curvy tangle with end-coloring, [bananatops on Tumblr](https://bananatops.tumblr.com/post/181563459168/wip-bandersnatch-endings-orange-circles-endings) came across 12 permanent (purple) ends and many more ends with the option to go back (orange):

Chartgeek [reposted](https://www.chartgeek.com/bandersnatch-choices/) a January 5th tree-style map by [Adam Smith](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=2066286660330218&id=100008467123346), who'd used a bit of color coding and some interesting time-banding:

Other maps I've spotted out there include a simple black-and-white, single path map [by annabel (@QUERTYFINGER) on Twitter](https://twitter.com/qwertyflnger/status/1078607639632887808) (December 28th), and a boxy blue map [by myanklesaresprained on imgur](https://imgur.com/gallery/zfVZtjz) (also December 28th).
