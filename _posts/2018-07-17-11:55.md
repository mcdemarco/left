I found *Killing Hitler With Praise And Fire* on a list of grown-up CYOA [at Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/18733.Adult_Choose_Your_Own_Adventure_Books) and, though the ratings there were uninspiring, I followed a link to [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Killing-Hitler-Praise-Fire-Horrible/dp/149284232X/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&linkCode=li2&tag=mcdema-20&linkId=d8ce74ae50bdf34180c61d6fc0994b85) and checked out those reviews as well.  Most of the positive reviews mentioned the novelty and nostalgia of finding a modern CYOA book. Other opinions ranged from "meh" to negative, with one interesting "review" in which the reviewer said nothing about the book except that it was not [this "book"](http://www.lukesurl.com/archives/comic/280-calvinism-but-no-hobbes).

Note: it's not available on Kindle.
