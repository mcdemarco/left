Gamebook News, one of the gamebook blogs I follow, [rounded up](http://gamebooknews.com/2018/06/03/june-round-up-new-and-upcoming/) a budding Star Wars CYOA series beginning with *A Han & Chewie Adventure*.  The series is named "Choose Your Destiny"; if that sounds like too good [a series title](/blog/2017/10/29/choose-your-own-series/) to be true, that's because it was, indeed, already taken by an old series of [teen angst CYOA stories](https://gamebooks.org/Series/1028).  Besides no longer being about teen life, the purloined series title is made doubly inappropriate by not being about the eponymous *you* at all; your choices decide Han Solo's destiny in this third-person tome, not your own.

It caught my attention, however, because the author and illustrator were [interviewed at StarWars.com](https://www.starwars.com/news/choose-han-solos-destiny-writer-cavan-scott-and-artist-elsa-charretier-discuss-their-charming-new-book) about the process of writing a gamebook---as it turned out---with no experience.  The tie-in and illustration angles are, perhaps, more informative.
