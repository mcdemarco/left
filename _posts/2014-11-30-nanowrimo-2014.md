Another year, another NaNo:  this was my eleventh [National Novel Writing Month](http://www.nanowrimo.org/), and my eleventh victory.  As I mentioned [last time](/blog/2013/11/30/nanowrimo-2013/), I took a couple of years off in the middle, so I've been NaNoing a long, long time.

The NaNoWriMo forums continued to be only minimally distracting this year, I think because of the strict regulation of threads.  The entire month of [Scrivener](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php) discussion was crammed into [one infinitely long thread](http://nanowrimo.org/forums/nano-technology/threads/176406) that encompassed praise, blame, raw incompetence (as well as cooked), and the annual last-minute Scrivener-miscounted-my-words emergency.

So for cat-vacuuming distraction, I instead made a few adjustments to the fantasy family tree generator from last year (as mentioned in [my last post](/blog/2014/11/12/family-tree-timelines/)), as well as to my (unpublished) conlang dictionary--a piece of software I started working on earlier this year.  I've always wanted a good way to maintain a dictionary for a conlang, and I'd like to give it away someday, but for the moment it is rather user-unfriendly and somewhat hard-coded to my current conlang (and conscript).

There was also a novel involved.  As has been my pattern lately, I had a vague outline for a fantasy novel which was very much fleshed out by the process of writing, but which I still only got about half-way through.  Some year I should make a greater effort to write a novella that will be all wrapped up with a bow by the fifty-thousandth word.  This was not that year.
