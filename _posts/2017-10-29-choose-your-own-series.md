In my recent encounters with dead tree hyperfiction, I've noticed that most writers name their series and/or add a subtitle to make it clear that the story is non-linear.  I thought it might be worthwhile to list the notable ones, as an aid to choosing your own series title.  Most of these have not been trademarked or used recently, so don't feel like one is off-limits without further research---or you can just mix up the words *adventure*, *choose*, *destiny*, *path*, and *way*.  I included some foreign-language titles when the translation (mine) was interesting.
