I supported the [Kingdom Builder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Builder) Big Box kickstarter, but only at the level of the Island expansion (a.k.a., Queenie 3), which arrived a while back.  Recently, I managed to fit in into my Little Big Box of the base set, the Nomads expansion, and the other two mini-expansions, Caves and Capitols.  (This was made difficult by the cute but bulky plastic boxes I use to hold the settlement pieces, but I prevailed.)

I wondered if there was a board randomizer that took into account the obscure, sometimes unpublished, rules for using the expansions; I [found one](http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/839074/free-javascript-kingdom-builder-setup-randomizer) that handled Capitols well, but not Caves or the Island at all.

So, something being incomplete on the Internet, I improved it.  Now it randomizes all expansions, either according to the various usage rules provided (or not provided) with the expansions---or the user can input odds for each expansion appearing, instead.  Try it out [here](/tools/kb/randomizer.html), or check out the source [at github](https://github.com/mcdemarco/kingdom-builder-randomizer).
