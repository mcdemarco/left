Via [GeekPress](http://www.geekpress.com/2006/08/japanese-scientists-plan-to-create.html):  [Physicists in Japan plan to create new universe in lab](http://www.casavaria.com/sentido/science/2006/06-0802-new-universe.htm).

> A radical new project could permit human beings to create a "baby universe" in a laboratory in Japan. While it sounds like a dangerous undertaking, the physicists involved believe that if the project is successful, the space-time around a tiny point within our universe will be distorted in such a way that it will begin to form a new superfluid space, and eventually break off, separate in all respects from our experience of space and time, causing no harm to the fabric of our universe.
