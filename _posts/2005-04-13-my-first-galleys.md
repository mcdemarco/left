I got my page proofs for a forthcoming story yesterday and made corrections today.  (I also renewed the lease, in case you were worried.)  I didn't expect to remember the story well enough to spot the editor's changes, but I found five or six of them, not counting a couple of typesetting typos.  I fixed the typos and more of my own mistakes---I really shouldn't be allowed near an em-dash---but I let the editing stay.  I'm not picky that way.

Now, on to my taxes...
