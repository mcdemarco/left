I've been meaning to post this link to [Kurt Vonnegut's rules for writing fiction](http://www.americanstate.org/vonnegut.html) (along with some other sets of fiction-writing rules) since before he passed away.  Now [BoingBoing](http://www.boingboing.net/2007/04/14/vonneguts_rules_for_.html) and others have beaten me to it.  As rules go, numbers 7 and 8 are the most unusual:

>(7) Write to please just one person. If you open a window and make love to the world, so to speak, your story will get pneumonia.<!--break-->
>
>(8) Give your readers as much information as possible as soon as possible. To heck with suspense. Readers should have such complete understanding of what is going on, where and why, that they could finish the story themselves, should cockroaches eat the last few pages.
