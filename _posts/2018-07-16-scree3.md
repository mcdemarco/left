I've updated [Scree](/tools/scree/), my Scrivener template for writing hyperfiction with Twine/Twee, to work with [Scrivener 3](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php).  Scrivener 3 is Mac-only right now, but there's the usual free 30-day-total trial for new and Scrivener 2 users.  The most notable improvement for Twine writing is that Scrivener 3 can now do automatic post-processing after compiling, plus it offers to open the resulting HTML story file for you.

You can still use the old template on Windows or in Scrivener 2 for Mac.
