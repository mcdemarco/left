A couple of NaNoWriMos ago I [surveyed the state of timeline software](/blog/2015/12/04/nanowrimo-2015/).  Since then, [Aeon Timeline](https://www.aeontimeline.com/) has been updated, but with no noticeable improvement to [their support for fantasy calendars](https://www.aeontimeline.com/support/custom-calendars/)---though it's hard to tell for sure that nothing has happened because they wiped out the forums (and the forum post where I described my need for configurable leap years).

If I were writing timeline software for custom calendars, it would definitely be more configurable than Aeon is; it would support other real calendars, like the Persian solar calendar(s), as well as well-known fantasy calendars like the Hobbit calendar---not to mention superimposing multiple calendars.  This is such a big omission from Aeon that I have to wonder what else they've done wrong.

Preceden, a timeline-making site I hadn't heard of last time, has a long [list of timeline makers](https://www.preceden.com/timeline-makers) on their website; scroll down for their detailed overviews and screenshots of each.
