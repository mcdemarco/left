Via [del.icio.us scifi](http://del.icio.us/tag/scifi): Greg Johnson of the SFSite posted his list of [the best novels of 2005](http://www.sfsite.com/lists/greg2005.htm).  He also has some interesting observations on the rise of the post-human novel:

> I would argue that what we have here is the first recognizable literary movement within science fiction since cyberpunk. Post-human SF is, at its best, a truly avante-garde off-shoot of hard science fiction and space opera that is pushing the boundaries of SF from within.
