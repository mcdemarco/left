I was going to title this post "Zombie Frodo," but that would imply some horrifying Lord of the Rings/Dawn of the Dead crossover, and this is just a quote I came across in my very slow rereading of the former.

> [Sam] took out all the things in his pack. Somehow each of them had become dear to him, if only because he had borne them so far with so much toil. Hardest of all it was to part with his cooking-gear. Tears welled in his eyes at the thought of casting it away. 
>
> 'Do you remember that bit of rabbit, Mr. Frodo?' he said. 'And our place under the warm bank in Captain Faramir's country, the day I saw an oliphaunt?'<!--break-->
>
> 'No, I am afraid not, Sam,' said Frodo. 'At least, I know that such things happened, but I cannot see them. No taste of food, no feel of water, no sound of wind, no memory of tree or grass or flower, no image of moon or star are left to me. I am naked in the dark, Sam, and there is no veil between me and the wheel of fire. I begin to see it even with my waking eyes, and all else fades.'

As usual, I thought I would have to type up the quote myself, yet I found it already done for me, at [Today in Middle Earth](http://timeandbs.blogspot.com/2005/01/faces-of-frodo-baggins-jan-28th.html), though as usual some corrections were required.
