I've added more [recipe indices](/recipes/indices/) to my cookbook.  Besides the original [Instant Pot index](/recipes/indices/ipIndex.html), there are now indices for [quick meals](/recipes/indices/quick.html), [favorites](/recipes/indices/favorites.html), [recent recipes](/recipes/indices/recent.html), and [an alphabetical list](/recipes/indices/alphabetical.html) of all recipes.

I still haven't solved the general issue of tagging my recipes; instead I added more flags to the YAML index for most of the new indices, and wrote some sketchy Liquid to generate the alphabetical list.
