I've been meaning to get categories working in the blog since way back when I [converted it to jekyll](/blog/2013/04/03/jekyll-and-left/), and now I've got it working, more or less.  This post, for example, should include a link to the [tools tag](/blog/tags/tools/).

I tried out a couple of plugins that did what I wanted ([jekyll-category-archive-plugin](https://github.com/shigeya/jekyll-category-archive-plugin) and [jekyll-tagging](https://github.com/pattex/jekyll-tagging/)) but not quite in the way I wanted to do it, so instead I used [Charlie Park's unpackaged plugin](http://charliepark.org/tags-in-jekyll/), with a few tweaks of my own.

To add a [list of all tags](/blog/tags/) with post counts, I followed advice from [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20945944/jekyll-liquid-output-category-list-with-post-count) and [elsewhere](http://blog.gladis.org/jekyll/2013/10/15/sorted-tag-cloud-for-jekyll-that-support-spaces.html), replacing the site.categories variable with site.tags.  You can infer the details from my [fork of Left](https://github.com/mcdemarco/left) if you're brave enough.

The hard part was getting the tags back onto my posts; most of them were displaced in the move to jekyll, though I kept a list of them.  While retagging old posts, I noticed that my [Terragen planet tutorial](/blog/2005/09/11/a-terragen-planet-tutorial/), although on the list under [Terragen](/blog/tags/terragen/), was missing. I recovered it from the Wayback Machine. Many links are broken (due to time and tides, not the recovery process), but my bit is there.
