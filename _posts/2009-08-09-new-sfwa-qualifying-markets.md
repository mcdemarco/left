title: New SFWA Qualifying Markets

I heard via a mailing list that [Flash Fiction Online](http://www.flashfictiononline.com/) is now a SFWA qualifying market (that is, one of the professional short fiction publications a sufficient number of sales to which qualify one for membership in the Science Fiction & Fantasy Writers of America organization).  I like writing flash (very short stories), so this may be my ticket to full SFWA membership.  A few other markets have gotten onto [the list](http://www.sfwa.org/join-us/sfwa-membership-requirements/#shortfiction) lately:  Tor.com, Apex, and the Grantville Gazette.  Announcements were made [here](http://www.sfwa.org/tag/qualifying-market/).

I'm one of those writers who only submits to professional markets, although it's more force of habit than strength of conviction now.  I only dimly recall the reasons---something to do with not disqualifying myself from amateur contests like [Writers of the Future](http://www.writersofthefuture.com/) without an equally notable publication to show for it.  Perhaps I also had doubts about the quality of upstart webzines at the time, although there are many fine upstarts (e.g., [Beneath Ceaseless Skies](http://www.beneath-ceaseless-skies.com/)) I would consider submitting to today.

In related news, [SFWA tweeted](http://twitter.com/sfwa/status/3159005067) that Jim Baen's Universe is shutting down in April.
