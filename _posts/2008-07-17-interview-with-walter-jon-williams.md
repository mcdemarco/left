Via [Night Shade Books](http://www.nightshadebooks.com/2008/07/16/interviews-and-reviews/):  [Concept Sci-fi](http://www.conceptscifi.com/iwjwilliams.htm) has an interview with Walter Jon Williams up.  On cyberpunk, he said:

> I'd like to suggest that there were a few key concepts to cyberpunk: the idea that the future would be filled with a tangle of subcultures rather than a single monoculture; the notion that subcultures would adapt technology for their own purposes; that the subcultures would be webbed together by electronic media; and that the future would be saturated by mass media and by messages generated by large corporate entities acting exclusively and without conscience for their own profit and power.<!--break-->
>
> That's not even controversial today.  That's what the future turned into: that's what today is all about.  I had thought I was writing 'Hardwired' about a future that existed sixty or eighty years out, and it turned out that I was writing about the year 2008.
