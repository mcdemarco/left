*Groundhog Day* is this week's 99 cent movie rental in the iTunes store.  According to Wikipedia,

> In 2006, Groundhog Day was added to the United States National Film Registry as being deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."<!--break--> It is listed as the 181st most popular movie at the Internet Movie Database as of Groundhog Day, 2008.

Since there's never a scientific or even speculative explanation of the time loop in which Our Anti-hero finds himself, I'm going to put this one in the supernatural fiction category along with *It's a Wonderful Life*.
