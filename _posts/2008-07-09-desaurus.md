Via [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2008/07/09/thsrs):  Ironic Sans  presents a beta of [Thsrs](http://www.thsrs.com/), the thesaurus of synonyms shorter than your original word.<!--break-->

I chose my title over the unpronounceably disemvowelled string *thsrs* because "desaurus" implies dumbing down both through the "de-" as prefix and the dialect allophone /d/ replacing both voiced and unvoiced /th/.  Unlike a real thesaurus, the desaurus takes your long, well-chosen word and replaces it with a shorter, less appropriate one--in order, I imagined, to dumb down your low-class characters' dialogue or even your company correspondence with a pointy-haired boss of poor reading comprehension skill.

Only afterwards did I read the [blog entry](http://www.ironicsans.com/2008/07/idea_thsrs_the_shorter_thesaurus.html) explaining that the purpose of the thsrs really is to shorten words for the purely orthographic purpose of fitting them into Twitter, text messages, and other character-counted form fields.

I still think my imagined uses are more common---who's going to look up synonyms at a web site when they could just disemvowel?---although Twitter is more interesting as a Procrustean shaper of language.
