I've been meaning to blog about [Andy Looney's remapping of *Life's Lottery*](http://new.wunderland.com/2020/08/12/a-map-of-lifes-lottery/) since I heard about it (h/t zarf).  I've added it to my [History of Choice Mapping](/blog/2017/10/27/history-of-choice-mapping/#L2020..Update.), as he takes a different approach from that of [Callum MacKendrickâ€™s definitive flowchart](/blog/2017/10/27/history-of-choice-mapping/#L2015) for the book.  (Please note that several Yahoo!Groups links in the History went offline with Yahoo!Groups and have been replaced with local copies.)

Also, RIP Ben Bova.
