Arthur C. Clarke passed away earlier today at 90.  See [ArthurCClarke.net](http://www.arthurcclarke.net/) for [links to commentary](http://www.arthurcclarke.net/?scifi=8) and [more](http://www.arthurcclarke.net/?scifi=4).  

I suspect he will be remembered for geosynchronous orbit and the alternate year 2001, but I remember his early short stories best:  "The Star," "The Nine Billion Names of God," "The Wall of Darkness."  And being a sucker for Big Dumb Objects, I'll also remember the later, longer *Rendezvous with Rama*, apparently soon to be a [motion picture](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0134933/).
