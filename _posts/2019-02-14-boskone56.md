Boskone, New England's longest-running science fiction and fantasy convention, begins tomorrow afternoon at 2pm, with an afternoon slate of free programming and gaming.  As usual, you can find out more about Boskone at [The Boskone Blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20190228140343/http://boskoneblog.com/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/boskonenews), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/boskone/), and [the Boskone website](https://b56.boskone.org).

I'm [on the schedule](https://b56.boskone.org/program-event/schedule-text-view/) again this Boskone, where I'll be talking about games, interactive fiction, free will, and Star Trek.
