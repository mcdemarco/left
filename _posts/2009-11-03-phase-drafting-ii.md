I decided to experiment with [phase drafting](/node/693) by using the phase system to write a prologue for my [NaNoWriMo](http://www.nanowrimo.org/) novel.  My outline was 180 words, with a target of 10 draft words per outline word.  Altogether this would have been just one day's writing on my usual NaNoWriMo schedule.

But it seems I did not have my phasing quite worked out, because I ended up with 3800 words---and I don't approve of prologues to start with.  I will have to try again with Chapter 1 and see if I can cram more detail into my outline.
