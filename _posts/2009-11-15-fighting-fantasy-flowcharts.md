Via [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/11/13/fighting-fantasy-flowcharts):  Fighting Fantasy, the gamebook-style line of Choose Your Own Adventure books, has been [flowcharted](http://outspaced.fightingfantasy.net/SVG_Flowcharts/main.html) by fans into some massive directed graphs.  The linked site covers some more minor series as well, along with a couple of classic Choose Your Own Adventure books---including, of course, the ever-chartable [The Cave of Time](http://outspaced.fightingfantasy.net/SVG_Flowcharts/CYOA001.svgz) (requires a real browser).

### Update

Note that the flowchart site has moved from the link given at Daring Fireball (and that he'd also mentioned these books [the day before](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/11/12/fighting-fantasy)); the links above have been corrected.
