I've been meaning to blog [Missile Gap](http://subterraneanpress.com/index.php/magazine/spring2007/fiction-missile-gap-by-charles-stross), a novella by Charlie Stross available online at Subterranean Press, since I read it a couple of weeks ago at the start of my current [Big Dumb Object](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dumb_Object)/[megastructure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megastructure) phase.  I spotted "Missile Gap" making the rounds at [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/tag/scifi) and was reminded to link it for its [Alderson disk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alderson_disk), if nothing else.<!--break-->  Here's part of the novella's blurb:

> It’s 1976 again. Abba are on the charts, the Cold War is in full swing — and the Earth is flat. It’s been flat ever since the eve of the Cuban war of 1962; and the constellations overhead are all wrong. Beyond the Boreal ocean, strange new continents loom above tropical seas, offering a new start to colonists like newly-weds Maddy and Bob, and the hope of further glory to explorers like ex-cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin: but nobody knows why they exist, and outside the circle of exploration the universe is inexplicably warped.
