Happy new year!

[Myrmex](http://mcdemarco.github.io/myrmex/) is one of my [JavaScript implementations](/games/decktet/) of solitaire games for the Decktet.  The latest version, 1.3, now autosaves and has some additional options you can check out in the settings.  Myrmex is set up to play offline and/or save to your iDevice home screen.

Many thanks to [Myrmex's devisor](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/37828/greg-james), both for Myrmex itself and for beta testing version 1.3.
