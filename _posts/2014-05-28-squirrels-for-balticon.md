We drove down to [Balticon 48](http://www.balticon.org) this past weekend, where we spotted one (1) meteor during the meteor "shower" and the long-awaited anthology *[Trafficking in Magic, Magicking in Traffic](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1617209457/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1617209457&linkCode=as2&tag=mcdema-20&linkId=FYYXFORPYCV46TGT)* in the dealers' room.  I got to meet the editors and a few fellow contributors in person for the first time, attend the release party, and sign a pile of books.  (So I know my story, "Squirrels for Kali", starts on page 201.)

Don't worry, there are a few more copies available for you to buy at the affiliate link above, and I've also updated [my Amazon store](http://astore.amazon.com/mcdema-20).
