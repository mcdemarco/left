I don't remember where I found the link, but [The DM of the Rings](http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=612) has provided me with hours of mock role-playing webcomic entertainment this week:

> Lord of the Rings is more or less the foundation of modern D&D. The latter rose from the former, although the two are now so estranged that to reunite them would be an act of savage madness. Imagine a gaggle of modern hack-n-slash roleplayers who had somehow never been exposed to the original Tolkien mythos, and then imagine taking those players and trying to introduce them to Tolkien via a D&D campaign.

If you want even more RPG/movie madness after 200 episodes or so of that, then [Darths & Droids](http://www.darthsanddroids.net/episodes/0001.html) is still going strong at turning all six Star Wars movies into an RPG webcomic.  Overall it's not as laugh-out-loud funny, but Jar-Jar and R2D2 are not to be missed.
