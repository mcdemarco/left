I made a few improvements to my [pnut.io](https://pnut.io) apps (formerly ADN apps) during this weekend's hackathon.  I haven't said much about them in the past because pnut was an invite-only service, but now it's also open to public signups.  So if you're interested in these apps, you can sign up and use them.

My pasteboard app, [Paste](https://paste.mcdemarco.net), is no longer as greedy for privileges when you authorize it; it will only read its own channels (unlike *some* apps I could mention, but won't).  I also fixed some issues with my old copy of highlight.js, and now Markdown highlighting, while still minimal, is obviously present.

My shopping list app, [Market Bucket](http://market-bucket.mcdemarco.net), got a manual refresh button (by request).  I thought a bit about making it more proactive about refreshing for you, but didn't actually code any of that.  Either way, refresh won't help you any unless you're using a shared list at the same time as another list member.
