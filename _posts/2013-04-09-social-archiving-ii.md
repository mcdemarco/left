Last time I linked to [my local twitter archive](/stream/tweets/) but failed to explain how to [download your own](http://blog.twitter.com/2012/12/your-twitter-archive.html)--so there you go.  It's much more useful than your Springpad archive; on the other hand, Springpad now has better embedding (~~http://springpad.com/blog/2013/03/how-to-embed-your-springpad-notebooks-into-your-website-or-blog/~~).  You can see my embedded [notebooks](/stream/springs/) and [recipes](/stream/springs/recipes.html) in the spruced up [social section](/stream/) of the site.

I also got rsync working for jekyll thanks to [this wise advice](http://nathangrigg.net/2012/04/rsyncing-jekyll/) from [Nathan Grigg](http://nathangrigg.net/), so I'm declaring the new site officially *up*.  However, my hosting service is not so up, so I'm waiting until it stabilizes a bit to take down the [github copy of the site](http://mcdemarco.github.com/).

**Update:** Springpad is dead and gone.
