I've spruced up the [social section](/social/) a bit and gotten rsync working thanks to [this helpful advice](http://nathangrigg.net/2012/04/rsyncing-jekyll/) from [Nathan Grigg](http://nathangrigg.net/), so I'm declaring the new site officially *up*.  However, my hosting service is not so up, so I'm waiting until it stabilizes a bit to take down the [github copy of the site](http://mcdemarco.github.com/).
