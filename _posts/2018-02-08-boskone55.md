Boskone 55 is coming up like a freight train!  In about a week (February 16--18, 2018) fans will gather in Boston for New England's longest-running science fiction and fantasy convention.  You can find out more about Boskone at [The Boskone Blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20180306192717/https://boskoneblog.com/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/boskonenews), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/boskone/), and [the Boskone website](https://b55.boskone.org).

I'm [on the schedule](https://b55.boskone.org/program-event/schedule-text-view/) for Boskone, where I'll be talking about games, Big Dumb Objects, medicine, fanfiction, and filk.
