Boskone 55 is coming up like a freight train!  In about a week (February 16--18, 2018) fans will gather in Boston for New England's longest-running science fiction and fantasy convention.  You can find out more about Boskone at [The Boskone Blog](https://boskoneblog.com/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/boskonenews), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/boskone/), and [the Boskone website](http://www.boskone.org/register/).

I'm [on the schedule](http://schedule.boskone.org/#part/20495) for Boskone, where I'll be talking about games, Big Dumb Objects, medicine, fanfiction, and filk.
