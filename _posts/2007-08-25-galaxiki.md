[Galaxiki](http://www.galaxiki.org/) is a wiki for a fictional galaxy, in which you can buy your own solar system or edit unclaimed planets.<!--break-->

The idea seems a little off to me, because the first thing I wanted when I looked at the website was my own *galaxy*, not my own solar system.  And older shared universes like [Orion's Arm](http://www.orionsarm.com/) look much more substantial.  Since I consider myself of average geekiness, my reactions don't seem promising for Galaxiki.
