At [Newsday](http://www.newsday.com/features/booksmags/ny-etdorislessing1011,0,1956124.story), Doris Lessing recalls the religion inspired by her space fiction series (the one she wishes more people would read):

> My science fiction books. "Canopus in Argos" had a great readership way back when, and it even started a religion. "Shikasta" [the first in the series] was taken literally and they started up a commune in America.<!--break--> They wrote to me and said, "When are we going to be visited by the gods?" And I wrote back, and said, "Look, this is not a cosmology, this is an invention." And they wrote back and said, "Ah, you are just testing us."

Lessing took the title _Shikasta_ from the Farsi _shekasteh_, broken, and her inspiration from Sufism, so it's not so surprising that fans found a cosmology in there.
