[NameVoyager](http://babynamewizard.com/namevoyager/) is a Java applet that shows the popularity of English baby names over the decades since 1900.  In the past I've used census name statistics to guess at near-future names, but this link is quicker and more fun.  [Via [GeekPress](http://www.geekpress.com/2005_02_17_daily.html)]
