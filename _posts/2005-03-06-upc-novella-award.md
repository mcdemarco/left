Someone on one of my mailing lists mentioned the UPC Novella awards.  Here's the blurb from [Locus](http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/UPC.html):

> The UPC awards go to winners of Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya's annual contest open to unpublished works written in Catalan, Spanish, English, or French, of novella length (between 70-115 typewritten pages). Entries are judges blindly. The prize is currently 6000 Euros (approx. $5200), making it the most profitable per-word award in the SF field.

Since the link at Locus was broken, I went googling.  The first clue I found was the real name of the award, *Premio UPC de Ciencia Ficción,* thanks to previous winner [Robert J. Sawyer](http://www.sfwriter.com/essayupc.htm), which led me to Orson Scott Card's speech from the 2003 awards ceremony, [Open Literature](http://www.upc.edu/english/sciencefiction/conferscottcard.htm).

At the bottom of the page are links to [last year's rules](http://www.upc.edu/english/sciencefiction/Rules.html) and contest information.  The deadline was September 15th and presumably will be again, so there's still plenty of time to write your novella.
