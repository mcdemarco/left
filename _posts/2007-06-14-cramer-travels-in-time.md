I had heard about the physicist raising money for time-travel experiments, but it wasn't until I saw [this article from the Seattle Post-Intelligencer](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/319367_timeguy12.html) that I realized the fundraising physicist was in fact John Cramer, frequent Analog contributor and author of the [transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics](http://www.npl.washington.edu/npl/int_rep/tiqm/TI_toc.html).  See the end of the Seattle PI article for how to contribute research funds.<!--break-->
