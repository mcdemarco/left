I took December 1st off, but according to [Alexandra Sokoloff](http://thedarksalon.blogspot.com/2009/12/nanowrimo-what-next.html), I don't deserve a break from my novel until it's actually finished.  I repented yesterday and went back to my novel, and also redeemed my 50% off coupon for Scrivener.

I'm not sure I'll be doing any of the other things suggested on my [I Wrote a Novel, Now What?](https://web.archive.org/web/20100306025449/http://www.nanowrimo.org/nowwhat) page.  The free proof of my novel from CreateSpace and [NaNoFiMo](http://nanofimo.net) sound tempting, but I have other things to write in December besides the second half of my novel.
