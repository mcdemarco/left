In response to a request on Discord, I've provided some [user CSS and JavaScript](/tools/scree/paloma/#Horizontal.scroll) for my Twine story format Paloma, a non-drop-in replacement for the popular Twine 1 stretchtext story format Jonah, to make it imitate Leon Arnott's horizontally-scrolling Jonah variant [Journal](https://www.glorioustrainwrecks.com/node/4997).  (I also added Journal to the [story format catalog](/tools/twine/catalog/).)  I found the scrolling a bit too slow for my tastes, but dealing with that would probably mean some internal changes to the story format, or going the way Leon went with a separate story format (which, of course, I would have to name Palomar).

In any event, the fiddling uncovered some Twine 1 bugs in Paloma, probably having to do with the initial refactoring to make the same codebase handle Twine 1 and 2, and hence to a newly repaired version of [Paloma](/tools/scree/paloma/): 1.1.2.  Twine 2 users should be unaffected either way.
