I've finally gotten around to reading *Blindsight* by Peter Watts.  More on the book itself will follow, but first I have to link his [flash presentation](http://www.rifters.com/blindsight/vampires.htm) on the creation of *Homo sapiens whedonum*.  Not only is it educational for those of us genetically engineering our own fantasy creatures at home, but it's also filled with dark corporate humor.<!--break-->  I don't know why, but I had to download [a freestanding flash player](http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20031214212712395) to get the video to play correctly on my PowerBook.

The notes to the [free ebook edition](http://manybooks.net/pages/wattspother06Blindsight/-1.html) survey the field briefly before getting into the same details the slideshow above provides:

> I'm hardly the first author to take a stab at rationalising vampirism in purely biological terms. Richard Matheson did it before I was born, and if the grapevine's right that damn Butler woman's latest novel will be all over the same territory before you even read this. I bet I'm the first to come up with the Crucifix Glitch to explain the aversion to crosses, though-- and once struck by that bit of inspiration, everything else followed.

The extended notes are also available in [a more convenient PDF format](http://www.rifters.com/real/shorts/PeterWatts_Blindsight_Endnotes.pdf).  There are plot spoilers in the notes, though not in the video.
