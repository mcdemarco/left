Via a mailing list:  [the Austin Daily News reports](http://www.kxan.com/dpp/news/Road_signs_warn_of_zombies) on zombie road signs.

The video shows all the zombie variations on the actual hacked construction sign.

Here are some other zombie links I've been saving up for an apocalyptic day:

Via Suvudu, the classic video [Zombies in Plain English](http://www.suvudu.com/2008/10/zombies-in-plain-english.html) shows you how to survive the coming undead apocalypse.
