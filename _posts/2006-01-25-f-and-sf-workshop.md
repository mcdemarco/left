It's not too late to register for [Michael Burstein](http://www.mabfan.com/)'s six-week [Fantasy & Science Fiction workshop](http://grubstreet.org/programs/mystery_writing.html) in Brookline. He'll be starting next Monday, since this Monday was snowed out.  You can find [the details](http://mabfan.livejournal.com/186521.html) and [an update](http://mabfan.livejournal.com/204482.html) in his LiveJournal.
