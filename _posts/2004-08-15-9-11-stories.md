 I don't care for most 9/11 stories, but Jeff Percifield linked [Cities of Dust](https://web.archive.org/web/20041029095627/http://www.beautifulatrocities.com/writing/cities3.htm) in his [blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20041209090141/http://www.beautifulatrocities.com/2004/08/pill-of-murti-bing-kompozycja-1918-by.html), and I liked it enough to read a related story, [An Exegesis of the Dragon](https://web.archive.org/web/20040706013452/http://www.beautifulatrocities.com/exegesis.htm).  Beware of weird hyphen problems.
