 I don't care for most 9/11 stories, but Jeff Percifield linked [Cities of Dust](http://www.beautifulatrocities.com/writing/cities3.htm) in his [blog](http://www.beautifulatrocities.com/2004/08/pill-of-murti-bing-kompozycja-1918-by.html), and I liked it enough to read a related story, [An Exegesis of the Dragon](http://www.beautifulatrocities.com/exegesis.htm).  Beware of weird hyphen problems.
