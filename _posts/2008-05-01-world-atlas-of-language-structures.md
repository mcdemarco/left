Via [Language Log](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=103): the [World Atlas of Language Structures](http://wals.info/feature/) from the [Max Planck Digital Library](http://www.mpdl.mpg.de/) is now freely available online, with Google Maps integration.  For example, here's [a map of the velar nasal (?) in Europe](http://wals.info/feature/9?v1=cd00&v2=cf6f&v3=cfff&s=20&tg_format=map&lat=45.82879925192134&lng=12.744140625&z=4&t=m).   Note the dot for England; that's the *ng* in *sing.*<!--break-->  (The [strangest sound in English](http://wals.info/feature/19?v1=cfff&v2=d000&v3=cff0&v4=s00d&v5=cd00&v6=dd00&v7=sd00&s=20&tg_format=map&lat=14.604847155053898&lng=12.3046875&z=2&t=m), however, is *th*.) 

Here's [a map of cha vs. te](http://wals.info/feature/138?v1=cd00&v2=c00d&v3=cccc&s=20&tg_format=map&lat=2.4601811810210052&lng=49.921875&z=2&t=m) as the source of the word for "tea."  The [chapter on writing systems](http://wals.info/feature/description/141) is informative but  unfortunately lacks a map.
