Via [del.icio.us sf](/aggregator/sources/24):  [Warren Ellis reports](http://www.warrenellis.com/?p=6240) on declining subscriptions to print science fiction and fantasy magazines.

> A few weeks ago, I received the new YEARâ€™S BEST SF volume as edited by Gardner Dozois. As ever, its indispensable "Summation" preamble contains the best available figures for the annual sales of the major sf magazines. <!--break--> Last year, I copied those sales numbers up here, and accidentally set off a bit of a storm in the sf blogosylum. Dozens of sites and hundreds of people got caught up in talking about the state of sf magazines and the condition of short sf, and what future, if any, they have.
