Via [Yehuda](http://jergames.blogspot.com/2007/12/go-wired-magazine.html):  Wired has [a year-end boardgame shopping guide](http://archive.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/multimedia/2007/12/YE_best_boardgames?slide=1&slideView=1) with an odd mix of classics and other stuff.  A commenter bemoans the lack of Carcassonne.

If you want something a little more biting this holiday season, there's always [War on Terror, the boad game](http://web.archive.org/web/20081224045106/http://www.waronterrortheboardgame.com/).
