This is a late [NaNoWriMo](http://www.nanowrimo.org/eng/user/4573) finish for me.  Usually I schedule an early completion to avoid the stress of last-minute noveling, but this month I got off-schedule and never quite got back on.  Now, thanks to a 10,000 word Thanksgiving weekend push, I have 50,000 words of a novel, a cool Viking winner's graphic, and an addiction to [House](http://www.fox.com/house/):<!--break-->

My favorite part of NaNoWriMo was opening the novel each day and seeing the last few completely nonsensical sentences I wrote before I fell asleep the previous evening---or, judging purely by their content, *after* I fell asleep.  This Saturday night's sleepwalking prose had to do with cannibals (there were no cannibals in the waking novel) and seems to have been influenced by a show about Aztecs that my sister had been complaining about earlier in the evening.  If these bits went on for more than one or two sentences at a time, I could end up with *Finnegans Wake*.
