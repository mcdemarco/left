At [io9](http://io9.com/5138216/samuel-delany-will-come-into-your-house-and-shred-your-notebooks):  Samuel Delany's *About Writing* is not your average how-to-write book.

>Instead, it's Delany's ruminations, gathered over the years, about both the craft of fiction writing and the writer's life in general.
>
> There are fantastic insights in there, as well as advice that might make you rethink everything about your approach to fiction writing â€” even if you end up disagreeing with some of it.
