I couldn't find a simple bookmarklet to unhijack tracking links (which often dead-end in my ad blocker and are a pain to reconstruct), so I wrote one:

`javascript:(function(){var%20k,x,n;var%20l=document.links;for(k=0;k<l.length;k++){x=l[k];n=x.href.split('http');if%20(n.length>2)%20x.href="http"%20+%20decodeURIComponent(n[2]);};})();`

Apply on the source page before clicking the link.
