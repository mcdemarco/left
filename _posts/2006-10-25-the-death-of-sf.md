A couple of links on the death-of-SF controversy via [Suzette Haden Elgin](http://ozarque.livejournal.com/326057.html):  [Charlie Stross](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2006/10/lets_put_the_future_behind_us.html) on what readers want to read today and [Andrew Wheeler](http://antickmusings.blogspot.com/2006/10/is-sf-dead-or-merely-dying.html) on who read what back in the 70s.
