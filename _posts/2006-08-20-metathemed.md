I've upgraded the blog/home page to Drupal 4.7.x and a speedier server, but I didn't upgrade my old home-cooked Drupal template.  For the moment I'm using [MetaTheme](http://metaskills.net/meta-theme-for-drupal/) by Ken Collins instead.  Play with the buttons at the top of the page to see what makes it meta.

Some other features of the site may be down for maintenance for a while longer, especially the news aggregator.  The management apologizes etc., etc.
