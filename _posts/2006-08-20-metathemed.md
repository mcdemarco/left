I've upgraded the blog/home page to Drupal 4.7.x and a speedier server, but I didn't upgrade my old home-cooked Drupal template.  For the moment I'm using [MetaTheme](https://www.drupal.org/project/meta) by [Ken Collins](http://metaskills.net/pages/colophon.html) instead.  Play with the buttons at the top of the page to see what makes it meta.

Some other features of the site may be down for maintenance for a while longer, especially the news aggregator.  The management apologizes etc., etc.
