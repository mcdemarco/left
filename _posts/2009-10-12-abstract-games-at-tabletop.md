[Tabletop](http://tabtop.blogspot.com/2009/04/introduction.html) is a new game blog I stumbled across while looking for Hex-like games, specifically, [the game of Y](http://tabtop.blogspot.com/2009/06/game-of-y.html).  So far, most of the games covered seem to be abstracts, ranging over classics like [Chess](http://tabtop.blogspot.com/2009/04/chess_13.html) and [Go](http://tabtop.blogspot.com/2009/06/go.html), new games like the computer-designed [Yavalath](http://tabtop.blogspot.com/2009/07/yavalath.html), and obscure games like the Javan [Surakarta](http://tabtop.blogspot.com/2009/04/surakarta.html).<!--break-->

Both Yavalath and Hex (a.k.a. Nash) are now available from [Nestor games](http://nestorgames.com/).
