Technically, the title is a spoiler for today's work of hyperfiction, [End _Game of Thrones_](https://v1.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/columns/pickyourpath/11216-End-Game-of-Thrones), but since the story is just a comic take from 2014 on the future of the HBO series, it's pretty well spoiled by now anyway.  "End _Game of Thrones_" is the last installment in a short-lived (2012--2014) *Pick Your Path* [CYOA series by Mike Kayatta](https://v1.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/columns/pickyourpath), posted to [The Escapist](https://www.escapistmagazine.com/), "the authoritative journalistic source for the mature enthusiast of escapist entertainment."

The story begins with a feint, and then returns, bottleneck- and show-style, inevitably to the fates of three main characters, which you may decide independently of each other.  When all are dead, on the Iron Throne, and/or otherwise disposed of, there is a final, financial denouement.

The bottlenecks are too tight to reward much rereading, unless you're particularly taken by the humor or irony of the piece.  I didn't get very far into the other four *Pick Your Path* stories for want of the appropriate video gaming background to appreciate them, but structurally they seemed quite similar to "End _Game of Thrones_", and much too linear for a [time-cave](https://heterogenoustasks.wordpress.com/2015/01/26/standard-patterns-in-choice-based-games/) fan like me.

I'll be at [Narrascope](http://narrascope.org) this weekend; review(s) to follow...
