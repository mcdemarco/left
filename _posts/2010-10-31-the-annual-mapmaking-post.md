In preparation for the upcoming month of procrastination and cat-vacuuming, I skimmed through my favorite NaNoWriMo forum last night, [NaNo Technology](http://www.nanowrimo.org/eng/forum/188), and found the usual topics--including how to make a map for your fantasy novel on your Mac.  Eager to help young cat-vacuumers, I [linked](http://www.nanowrimo.org/eng/node/3768944) my [list from two years back](http://www.mcdemarco.net/node/503) and even dug up two new cross-platform map-making options:

* [Hexographer](http://www.inkwellideas.com/roleplaying_tools/hexographer/free_hexographer.shtml), a Java-based program online
* [GrumbleMapper](http://evanjacover.com/grumblemapper), an AIR-based donationware download that lets you [add your own tiles](http://code.google.com/p/grumblemapper/wiki/CreatingTiles)

Just remember, the map does not count towards your word count!
