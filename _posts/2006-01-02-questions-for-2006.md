Via a mailing list:  The _Edge_ Annual Question for 2006 is [What is your dangerous idea?](http://www.edge.org/q2006/q06_index.html)  Over a hundred forward thinkers answered the following question.

> The history of science is replete with discoveries that were considered socially, morally, or emotionally dangerous in their time; the Copernican and Darwinian revolutions are the most obvious. What is your dangerous idea? An idea you think about (not necessarily one you originated) that is dangerous not because it is assumed to be false, but because it might be true?
