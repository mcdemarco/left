 I've added an excerpt from ["The Great Popularity"](http://www.mcdemarco.net/gkc/quotes/popularity.html), chapter 5 of G. K. Chesterton's [_Charles Dickens_](http://www.readprint.com/work-397/Gilbert-Keith-Chesterton), to [my GKC pages](http://www.mcdemarco.net/gkc/).  Although he didn't use the word "genre" 98 years ago, he did argue that quality and genre are orthogonal aspects of fiction.
