The [National Novel Writing Month site](http://www.nanowrimo.org/) is up and chock-full of cats to vacuum.  I've already updated [my profile](http://www.nanowrimo.org/eng/user/4573) with skeletal information about my planned zombie novel and participated in my first thread of the season, on [Blogging During Nano](http://www.nanowrimo.org/eng/node/3002486#comment-3041482).<!--break-->

It's good to see that NaNoWriMo is still using Drupal, the same ornery, flaky, yet all-powerful platform that I use for most of my website.  Maybe I can even authorize remote logins from NaNoWriMo accounts, like drupal.org users already have.
