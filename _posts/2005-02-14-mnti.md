There was [a Guardian article this weekend](http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/story/0,,1409903,00.html) [link via [GeekPress](http://www.geekpress.com/2005_02_14_daily.html)]  about autistic savant Daniel Tammet:

> He describes what he sees in his head. That's why he's exciting. He could be the Rosetta Stone.

I was hoping to see some of those Rosetta Stone inscriptions in the article.  No such luck, but I did find out that he's a conlanger.  His language is called Mänti.  The article makes it sound like a [philosophical language](http://www.langmaker.com/mlclass.htm):

> The vocabulary of his language - "Mänti", meaning a type of tree - reflects the relationships between different things. The word "ema", for instance, translates as "mother", and "ela" is what a mother creates: "life". "Päike" is "sun", and "päive" is what the sun creates: "day". Tammet hopes to launch Mänti in academic circles later this year, his own personal exploration of the power of words and their inter-relationship.

Since Mänti hasn't been launched yet, there are no web resources about it.
