I didn't blog [the latest Grub St. F&SF workshop](http://mabfan.livejournal.com/218119.html) in time, but maybe this link will help aspiring writers:  the [Odyssey Critique Service](http://www.sff.net/odyssey/crit.html) is open for business.

> The Odyssey Critique Service provides authors a method of receiving professional-level feedback done in accordance with Odyssey principles and with the thoroughness and depth for which Odyssey is known.
