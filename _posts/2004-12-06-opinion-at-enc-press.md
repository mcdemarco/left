 [ENC Press](http://www.encpress.com/) redid their web site and has a couple of opinion pieces up about the poverty of literary fiction and poetry today: 

>GET BACK IN THAT BOX!  
>Olga Gardner Galvin  
>_Literature is and always has been a form of storytelling, not of art._

>"THE GREATEST GODDAMN THING THAT EVER WAS" AND, AT THIS RATE, WILL
>NEVER BE AGAIN   
>Michael Antman  
>_James Dickey's opinion that Poetry Is the Greatest Goddamn Thing Etcetera no longer passes the smell test._

Both can be found on their new [opinion page](http://www.encpress.com/opinion.html).
