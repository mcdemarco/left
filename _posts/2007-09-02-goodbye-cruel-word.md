Via [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/september#sun-02-poole):  [Steven Poole](http://stevenpoole.net/blog/goodbye-cruel-word/) says goodbye to Word.

> Microsoft Word still uses the metaphor of the page, the computer screen that imitates a blank, bounded sheet of physical paper. For me, this is outdated and unimaginative. It has become a barrier rather than a window.<!--break--> And there is always the distraction of changing font and line-spacing, jumping ahead too quickly to imagining the text as a visual, physical product instead of a process, a fluid semantic interplay. Instead, turning my MacBook into a kind of replica 1980s IBM machine, with the words glowing and hovering in an interstellar void, is liberating: as though I am composing the Platonic ideal of a text that might eventually take many different forms.
