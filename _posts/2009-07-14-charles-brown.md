[Locus](http://www.locusmag.com/News/2009/07/charles-n-brown-1937-2009.html) has an obituary up for Charles Brown.  

> Brown co-founded Locus with Ed Meskys and Dave Vanderwerf as a one-sheet news fanzine in 1968, originally created to help the Boston Science Fiction Group win its Worldcon bid. Brown enjoyed editing Locus so much that he continued the magazine far beyond its original planned one-year run.<!--break--> Locus was nominated for its first Hugo Award in 1970, and Brown was a best fan writer nominee the same year. Locus won the first of its 29 Hugos in 1971.

Locus's new editor will be Liza Groen Trombi.
