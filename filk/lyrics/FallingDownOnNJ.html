		<h1>Falling Down on New Jersey</h1>
		<h3>&copy;1990 Mitchell Burnside Clapp</h3>

 It's a damn tough life far from home and wife<br>
 &nbsp; that we astronauts undergo.<br>
 And we don't give a damn when the mission's done<br>
 &nbsp; just how far the ship did go.<br>
 But you'll be sad to learn our de-orbit burn<br>
 &nbsp; won't be made for the tanks are empty.<br>
 And the fuel line's torn, so you'd better warn<br>
 &nbsp; all the folks in New Jersey.<br>

		<p style="font-style:italic;">
			<b>Chorus:</b>
			<br>
			We're falling down on New Jersey, me boys;<br>
			&nbsp; Falling down on New Jersey.<br>
			We thought it wise to apologize<br>
			&nbsp; To the folks in New Jersey.<br>
		</p>
		
 Well it's widely known that a ship alone<br>
 &nbsp; would be burned up and destroyed.<br>
 But the ship and crew brought with us too<br>
 &nbsp; an eleven mile asteroid.<br>
 So when you've awoken all the folks in Hoboken<br>
 &nbsp; and the profs at Princeton too,<br>
 We'll divulge the fact that the rock's impact<br>
 &nbsp; will be at 7:32.<br>

		<p style="font-style:italic;">
			We're falling down on New Jersey, me boys;<br>
			&nbsp; Falling down on New Jersey.<br>
			We thought it wise to apologize<br>
			&nbsp; To the folks in New Jersey.<br>
		</p>

 Well, why all the shock? Hell it's just a rock.<br>
 &nbsp; Are we just alarmist fools?<br>
 But it has, you see, potential energy<br>
 &nbsp; of roughly ten to the nineteenth joules.<br>
 With the rock's advance there is Buckley's chance<br>
 &nbsp; that the Garden State'll be spared.<br>
 And soon we'll show (if you didn't know)<br>
 &nbsp; E is one-half MV squared.<br>

		<p style="font-style:italic;">
			We're falling down on New Jersey, me boys;<br>
			&nbsp; Falling down on New Jersey.<br>
			We thought it wise to apologize<br>
			&nbsp; To the folks in New Jersey.<br>
		</p>

 We will strike a spark that'll toast Newark<br>
 &nbsp; and will flatten Perth Amboy.<br>
 It won't be pretty in Atlantic City.<br>
 &nbsp; You should shade your eyes in Troy.<br>
 Even so, and yet, we have one regret:<br>
 &nbsp; that we haven't the delta V<br>
 To push it forth just a few miles north<br>
 &nbsp; to land smack on NYC.<br>

		<p style="font-style:italic;">
			We're falling down on New Jersey, me boys;<br>
			&nbsp; Falling down on New Jersey.<br>
			We thought it wise to apologize<br>
			&nbsp; To the folks in New Jersey.<br>
		</p>
 		<p style="font-style:italic;">
			We're falling down on New Jersey, me boys.<br>
			&nbsp; Falling down on New Jersey.<br>
			We apologize--gee we're sorry guys!<br>
			&nbsp; What a drag for New Jersey.
		</p>
