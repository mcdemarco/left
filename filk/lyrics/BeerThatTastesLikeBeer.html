			<b>Chorus:</b>
			<br>
			Oh, here's to beer that tastes like beer!<br>
			An amber glass of wholesome cheer<br>
			A noble brew that has no peer<br>
			Beer that tastes like beer!
		</p>
 
For centuries the brewers' craft<br>
Produced the most exquisite draft<br>
When he brews with what he oughta<br>
Barley, hops, malt, yeast and water.<br>
 
		<blockquote style="font-style:italic;">
			Here's to beer that tastes like beer!<br>
			An amber glass of wholesome cheer<br>
			A noble brew that has no peer<br>
			Beer that tastes like beer!

Let cheese be cheese and bread be bread<br>
Don't serve us soap or sponge instead<br>
While sausages may cause some fear<br>
For goodness sake let beer be beer!<br>
 
		<blockquote style="font-style:italic;">
			So, here's to beer that tastes like beer!<br>
			An amber glass of wholesome cheer<br>
			A noble brew that has no peer<br>
			Beer that tastes like beer!
		</blockquote>
 
Among the most requested favors<br>
Please avoid exotic flavors<br>
Fruits and nuts and spices queer<br>
Have no place in honest beer!<br>
 
		<blockquote style="font-style:italic;">
			So, here's to beer that tastes like beer!<br>
			An amber glass of wholesome cheer<br>
			A noble brew that has no peer<br>
			Beer that tastes like beer!
		</blockquote>
 
Oh stay the bung don't drive the spile<br>
On concoctions rank with adjuncts vile<br>
Cornflakes, rice and rats from sewers<br>
Fine for cooks but not for brewers<br>
 
		<blockquote style="font-style:italic;">
			Here's to beer that tastes like beer!<br>
			An amber glass of wholesome cheer<br>
			A noble brew that has no peer<br>
			Beer that tastes like beer!
		</blockquote>
 
So stick with what is good and true<br>
A beery tasting smelling brew<br>
Then you'll earn our highest rating<br>
Refreshing yet intoxicating!<br>

		<blockquote style="font-style:italic;">
			Here's to beer that tastes like beer!<br>
			An amber glass of wholesome cheer<br>
			A noble brew that has no peer<br>
			Beer that tastes like beer!
