My traditionally-published fiction is listed in my [bibliography](/bio/biblio.html); here is stuff you can read without paying for it.  (The sets are not completely disjoint, and you're always welcome to pay anyway/again at [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/mcdemarco).)

## 2017

[*Choose Your Own Writing Career*](writer.html), a Twine (a.k.a. hyperfiction, a.k.a. CYOA) story I wrote back in the day but only brushed up and published in October, 2017, is hosted here.  You can read more about it [in the blog](/blog/2017/10/17/choose-your-own-writing-career/), in the [interactive fiction database](http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=8bmlu5i76uf7x1yb), or in the colophon to the story.  At the IFDB I described it as "a circular parody of the writing life."

## 2010

One work of microfiction is up at [thaumatrope](http://thaumatrope.greententacles.com/contributors/mcdemarco/stories/).
