<p>App.net is the new more-than-twitter, which I joined soon after it went freemium. (I'm user #68,560.)  I got my invite by googling for free invites, not by knowing anyone on app.net, and I encourage others to do the same.  Now I have a developer membership and an app of my own:  <a href="/blog/2013/09/13/paste/">Paste</a>.</p>
