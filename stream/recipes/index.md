I've moved my recipes from SpringPad to Penflip, where they were much easier to read and [export](export.html), to [GitHub](https://github.com/mcdemarco/the-new-kitchen-cookbook), where they are much easier to update.  You can also read them starting from the [table of contents](/recipes/) or delve into [the blog archives](/blog/tags/recipes/) for the typesetting details.
