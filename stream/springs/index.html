  <p>I had a few public notebooks on Springpad, most notably my <a href="recipes.html">recipes</a>, which fortunately moved to <a href="">Penflip</a> before Springpad's mid-2014 demise.  I also found Springpad handy for gathering a mess of links for various projects in private notebooks, now languishing in my Springpad backup files.</p>
