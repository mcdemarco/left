<p>"Here are some questions:</p>

<p>1.  Do you ever derive secret, guilty pleasure from reading best-sellering authors that the writing community derides as 'talentless hacks?'
2.  Do you tend to prefer books that are hard to find at the local Borders, yet are praised by professional writers, editors, and book critics?
3.  Do you find it refreshing to discuss books with people whose sole interest in writing is fan fiction or role playing games?
4.  Do you believe there is a dichotomy between the books that writers like and the books that fans like, and if so, is there a cause other than marketing?
5.  Do you believe in author snobbery, and do you think it hurts or helps (or doesn't affect) the book industry?</p>
