<p>"Here are some questions:</p>

<p>1.  Do you ever derive secret, guilty pleasure from reading best-sellering authors that the writing community derides as 'talentless hacks?'</p>

<p>2.  Do you tend to prefer books that are hard to find at the local Borders, yet are praised by professional writers, editors, and book critics?</p>

<p>3.  Do you find it refreshing to discuss books with people whose sole interest in writing is fan fiction or role playing games?</p>

<p>4.  Do you believe there is a dichotomy between the books that writers like and the books that fans like, and if so, is there a cause other than marketing?</p>

<p>5.  Do you believe in author snobbery, and do you think it hurts or helps (or doesn't affect) the book industry?</p>
