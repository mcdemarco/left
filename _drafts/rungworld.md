Today's Big Dumb Object (BDO) is the [Rungworld](http://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/4914a713197fe), a ring-shaped ladder whose rungs are [O'Neill colonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Neill_cylinder)  (rotating cylindrical habitats at least 20 miles long and 5 miles in diameter) or their larger cousins, [McKendree cylinders](http://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/48473a892041c).  The rungs rotate individually for gravity as in a [Bucky Habitat](http://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/4cd1c52672b71), and the sides of the ladder serve to prevent precession.

The Rungworld has not appeared in fiction outside of [Orion's Arm](http://www.orionsarm.com/xcms.php?r=oa-intro), but Isaac Arthur discusses them in several of [his](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8ryqjyLBL8) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlmKejRSVd8).  He suggests using the sides of the ladder for transportation between the individual rungs.
