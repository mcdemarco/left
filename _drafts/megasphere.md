Today's Big Dumb Object (BDO) is a Megasphere, a Dyson sphere built around a galactic core.  It's apparently the creation of Larry Niven, who described it in [his classic megastructures essay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigger_Than_Worlds) without crediting anyone else.

People would live on the outside of the sphere, whose surface area would be "tens of millions of light years" [sic].  They would have to adapt to the microgravity, but would have an atmosphere that was "scores of light years" deep, in which they could build other megastructures, and float between them at their leisure.
