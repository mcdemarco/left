Today's Big Dumb Object (BDO) is a [Bucky habitat](http://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/4cd1c52672b71), a skeletal arrangement of rotating-for-gravity O'Neill or McKendree cylinders into a larger structure.  Bucky Habitats are classified as having either a triangular or hexagonal arrangement, and any other arrangement is called a Kepler habitat instead.  (The rungworld is not a Kepler habitat because the sides of the ladder are not themselves habitats.)

It's not clear who first invented the Bucky Habitat, nor is it clear whether any particular arrangement (say, a closed structure) is intended or required.  Orion's Arm mentions a Bucky Habitat in the shape of a Dyson sphere along the lines of the [Hex](/blog/2017/09/12/bdo-hex/), but larger, and also shows a complex Kepler habitat called [Kepleria](http://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/4670a60a449d5).

Bucky Habitats have not appeared in fiction outside of [Orion's Arm](http://www.orionsarm.com/xcms.php?r=oa-intro) and the variant in Hex, but Isaac Arthur discusses them in, for example, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8ryqjyLBL8), where he mentions another name for them:  polyhedral habitats.
