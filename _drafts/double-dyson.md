Today's Big Dumb Object (BDO) is a Double Dyson, a pair of nested Dyson spheres intended to solve the gravitational issues of a single Dyson sphere by creating an area of atmosphere but microgravity between the two spheres.  The inner shell would be transparent.  In his [his classic megastructures essay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigger_Than_Worlds), Larry Niven credits Dan Alderson (of disk fame) with the idea.
