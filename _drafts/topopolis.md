I mentioned today's Big Dumb Object (BDO) in [a recent post](/blog/2017/09/11/epic-genre-objects/) because I find it one of the most practical of the lot:  a [Topopolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topopolis) is a toroidal or knottier O'Neill cylinder of big, dumb dimensions.  It's notable in that it rotates O'Neill-wise (around its cylindrical axis), which is far more physically plausible than rotating around its empty center (presumably occupied by a sun).

In [his classic megastructures essay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigger_Than_Worlds), Larry Niven credited the Topopolis to Pat Gunkel under than name, but he also nicknamed them Cosmic Spaghetti.  He didn't think they needed to be closed; instead he envisioned them growing unchecked into other star systems:

> With the interstellar links using power supplied by the inner coils, the tube city would expand through the galaxy. Eventually our aegagropilous galactotopopolis would look like all the stars in the heavens had been embedded in hair.
