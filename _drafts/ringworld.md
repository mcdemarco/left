Today's Big Dumb Object (BDO) is a Ringworld, the familiar creation of Larry Niven, who described it thus in [his classic megastructures essay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigger_Than_Worlds):

> I myself have dreamed up an intermediate step between Dyson spheres andplanets. Build a ring 93 million miles in radius---one Earth orbit---which would make it 600 million miles long. If we have the mass of Jupiter to work with, and if we make it a million miles wide, we get a thickness of about a thousand meters. The Ringworld would thus be much sturdier than a Dyson sphere.
>
> There are other advantages. We can spin it for gravity. A rotation on its axis of 770 miles/second would give the Ringworld one gravity outward. We wouldn't even have to roof it over. Put walls a thousand miles high at each rim, aimed inward at the sun, and very little of the air will leak over the edges.
>
> Set up an inner ring of shadow squares-light orbiting structures to block out part of the sunlight-and we can have day-and-night cycles in whatever period we like. And we can see the stars, unlike the inhabitants of a Dyson sphere.
>
> The thing is roomy enough; three million times the area of the Earth. It will be some time before anyone complains of the crowding. As with most of these structures, our landscape is optional, a challenge to engineer and artist alike. A look at the outer surface of a Ringworld or Dyson sphere would be most instructive. Seas would show as bulges, mountains as dents. River beds and river deltas would be sculpted in; there would be no room forerosion on something as thin as a Ringworld or a Dyson sphere.

He goes on to say that the seas would be shallow qua purely cosmetic, but that doesn't seem like the proper way to make an environment to me.  We would certainly be giving up large-scale tectonic change on a Ringworld, though, and erosion would need to be kept under control.

He also explains how to move a Ringworld by moving its sun with "a jet of [solar] gas along the Ringworld axis of rotation".
