[Kingdom Builder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Builder) is my favorite board game; at one point I was inspired to generate random Kingdom Builder boards.  I included the generator in [my blog post](/blog/2013/05/21/kingdom-board-builder/), but you can find it on [a separate page here](board-builder.html).

I also updated an existing random layout generator for Kingdom Builder to include more expansions; read more about it [in the blog](/blog/2014/12/10/kingdom-builder-randomizer), or just use it to [generate a layout](randomizer.html) for your game.
