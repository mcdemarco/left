The [Random Family Tree Generator](/tools/family-tree-generator/lineage.html) is a product of NaNoWriMo 2013, during which I needed to populate several dwarf clans, fast.  I found a few versions of a generator for random medieval family trees (of descendants of a matriarch/patriarch pair) online, to which I added a bunch of features that I needed:

* generation of non-human and otherwise non-medieval family trees
* editing of any aspect of a generated tree
* display of the output as an actual tree (in addition to an indented list or a CSV file)
* generation of full trees up to a specified date
* various improved methods of name generation
* a name list viewer
* optional clan generation
* detailed instructions for use

I didn't actually need the detailed instructions, but as the thing was getting a bit complex I expanded them accordingly.  The source code is available at [github](https://github.com/mcdemarco/family-tree-generator), along with [more gory details](https://github.com/mcdemarco/family-tree-generator/blob/master/README.md).  I also shared a little sausage [in the blog](/blog/2014/01/14/family-tree-generator/).

A bug involving overpopulation of the clan dropdowns on switching species has been fixed.
