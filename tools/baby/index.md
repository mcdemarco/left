I made an [adjusted age calculator](/tools/baby/aac.html) that will save dates across sessions and give adjusted and unadjusted ages in various formats, using [moment.js](https://momentjs.com) and vanilla JavaScrip.  It can also determine due date from the last period or vice versa.

That's it so far.
