<p><a href="/tools/scree/dotscap/">DotScap</a> is a proofing format that lays out a Twine story as a <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scapple/overview">Scapple</a> mind map.  
	However, to go in the other direction---from a Scapple file to a Twine story---requires more than just a story format.  
	This page will do the conversion for you, entirely in your browser.  (When you "upload" your file, nothing is sent to the server.)
</p>

<p>What do you end up with?  
	Well, a very simple story file with passages in the same positions they were in in Scapple, with the names and links they had there.
	A somewhat random passage may be chosen to be your start passage.

<h3>Upload a Scapple File</h3>

<p><label for="title">Title: </label> <input type="text" id="title" value=""/></p>

<p><input type="file" id="scappleFile" onchange="handleFile();"></p>

<div id="testdiv"></div>

<h3>Sausage</h3>

<p>Scapple's underlying file format is XML; this page uses XSLT to transform it into the pseudo-HTML used by Twine.</p>
