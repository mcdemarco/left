Enscree is my one-time-use story format for exporting a Twine 2 story into a MultiMarkdown format used for importing into Scrivener/Scree.
This is not a task that a twee can do.  Enscree creates an HTML file that in turn creates (and possibly downloads) the plain text MultiMarkdown file.

### Installation

To add Enscree to Twine 2, use this URL (under Formats > Add a New Format): `https://mcdemarco.net/tools/scree/enscree/format.js`

If you want to run Enscree with a twee compiler like TweeGo or Twee2, you should use it like a normal story format to create the story, then open the story in a browser to prompt the creation and possibly download of the plain text markdown file.

### Versions

The current version is 1.1.1, with a bracket bugfix (h/t AnotherRPGEnthusiast).

The previous version was 1.1.0, which output a MultiMarkdown file with Unix newlines, archived [here](/tools/scree/enscree/1.1.0/).

The previous previous version was 1.0.1, which output Windows linefeeds, archived [here](/tools/scree/enscree/1.0.1/).
