Enscree is my one-time-use story format for exporting a Twine 2 story into a MultiMarkdown format used for importing into Scrivener/Scree.  This is not a task that a twee can do.  Enscree creates an HTML file that in turn creates the plain text MultiMarkdown file.

### Installation

To add Enscree to Twine 2, use this URL (under Formats > Add a New Format): `https://mcdemarco.net/tools/scree/enscree/format.js`
