Enscree is my one-time-use story format for exporting a Twine 2 story into a MultiMarkdown format used for importing into Scrivener/Scree.  This is not a task that a twee can do.  Enscree creates an HTML file that in turn creates the plain text MultiMarkdown file.

### Installation

To add Enscree to Twine 2, use this URL (under Formats > Add a New Format): `https://mcdemarco.net/tools/scree/enscree/format.js`   

### Versions

The current version is 1.1.0, which outputs a MultiMarkdown file with Unix newlines.

The previous version was 1.0.1, which output Windows linefeeds.  If you have trouble with the current version, you can install the previous with the URL: `https://mcdemarco.net/tools/scree/enscree/1.0.1/format.js`
