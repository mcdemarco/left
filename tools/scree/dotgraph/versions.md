The current version of [DotGraph](/tools/scree/dotgraph/) is 2.1.0, which adds a text tracing option and support for configuration using the StorySettings passage.

#### Previous Versions

* [Version 2.1.0](/tools/scree/dotgraph/2.1.0/): Added a text tracing option and support for configuration using the StorySettings passage.

* [Version 2.0.6](/tools/scree/dotgraph/2.0.6/): Included display macro support for Harlowe and fixed a leaf counting issue.

* [Version 2.0.5](/tools/scree/dotgraph/2.0.5/): Included an option to use last tag for tag colors/clusters, plus fixed a start node issue.

* [Version 2.0.4](/tools/scree/dotgraph/2.0.4/): A minor bugfix release involving tags.

* [Version 2.0.3](/tools/scree/dotgraph/2.0.3/): Counted and styled unreachable passages.  (This may slow DotGraph down for especially large stories.)

* [Version 2.0.2](/tools/scree/dotgraph/2.0.2/): Included support for omitting passages by tag.

* Version 2.0.1: Optionally parsed `<<display>>` links.  No release (use 2.0.2).

* [Version 2.0.0](/tools/scree/dotgraph/2.0.0/): Included support for Twine 1, offline use, omitting special passages, and renumbering nodes.

* [Version 1.1.5](/tools/scree/dotgraph/1.1.5/): Included a save option for the SVG and some bugfixes.

* [Version 1.1.4](/tools/scree/dotgraph/1.1.4/format.js): Included various graph configuration options and editing of the dotgraph source.

* [Version 1.1.3](/tools/scree/dotgraph/1.1.3/format.js): Included highlighting of terminal nodes, and special highlighting for the tag "End".

* [Version 1.1.2](/tools/scree/dotgraph/1.1.2/format.js): Included clustering on tags.  It uses only one tag per passage due to Graphviz restrictions (clusters cannot overlap).

* [Version 1.1.1](/tools/scree/dotgraph/1.1.1/format.js): Produced graphs colored by node length, with detection of missing nodes, and better detection of the start node.

* [Version 1.1.0](/tools/scree/dotgraph/1.1.0/format.js): Produced black-and-white graphs, with poor detection of the start node.
