<p class="p3">About This Template</p>
<p class="p4">By default, when compiled (File &gt; Compile), this project will generate a plain text file for compilation with Twee2 (<a href="http://twee2.danq.me">http://twee2.danq.me</a>), a text format used with the Twine 2 (<a href="http://twinery.org">http://twinery.org</a>) interactive fiction tools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Your output can be compiled directly into an interactive story, which can also be opened in Twine's visual editor.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">How To Use This Template</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">Under Draft, create a new text document for each node in your interactive story, and give each one a unique title. A few such scenes have been created for you with the placeholder titles "Scene 1", "Scene 2", etc.</li>
  <li class="li4">Link between nodes of your story with Markdown-style links such as [[Scene 1]] or [[The longer description of scene 1 that I want my reader to see-&gt;Scene 1]].<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To this end, it helps to name the scenes with the text you want to show the reader, such as [[Talk to the mysterious man]].</li>
  <li class="li4">All other text in your story sections should be Markdown or plain text, with blank lines between paragraphs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Using the italic, bold, or other font settings within Scrivener will have no effect.</li>
  <li class="li4">You can nest the text documents in folders or under each other as shown in the example scenes, but this is not necessary.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All text scenes will be treated as nodes of the story, and all folder information will be ignored.</li>
  <li class="li4">When you are done, compile your story.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This will output a plain-text Twee or Twee2 file, which you can then process with Twee2 into an HTML story file which you can open in any browser.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You can also import the HTML story file into the Twine2 visual editor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Twine v.1 should also work with the Twee format.)</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Compiling with Scrivener</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">The title of the story must be in a specific format set up for you in the “Front Matter” folder (between the “Draft” and “Research” folders). It defaults to the project title, but you can replace the Scrivener title placeholder with a different title if you desire.</li>
  <li class="li4">Scrivener remembers your compile settings, so you only need to go to File &gt; Compile… and click the “Compile” button.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you change any compile settings, Scree may no longer work.</li>
  <li class="li4">There are two compile options, Twee2 and Twee.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unless you plan to use Twine 2, they make little difference; see Import/Export for more details.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Compiling with Twee2</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">Install Twee2 (<a href="http://twee2.danq.me">http://twee2.danq.me</a>), as follows:</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <ol class="ol1">
    <li class="li4">If your system is not running Ruby 2.0, follow the instructions at the Twee2 site to install that first.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Note that newer versions of MacOS probably are running Ruby 2.0, despite the warning there.) <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
    <li class="li4">Open a command prompt or terminal and type:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span class="s2">gem install twee2</span></li>
  </ol>
  <li class="li4">After compiling your story in Scrivener, open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory containing your compiled file.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(For help with this, see <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Change-Directories-in-Command-Prompt">http://www.wikihow.com/Change-Directories-in-Command-Prompt</a>.)</li>
  <li class="li4">If, for example, you saved your compiled story as <span class="s2">mystory.txt</span>, then you would type the following in the command prompt or terminal:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span class="s2">twee2 build mystory.txt mystory.html</span></li>
  <li class="li4">Twee2 will give you a warning about a StoryIFID.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You can ignore this warning, or you can copy the text it gives you into the StoryTitle document in Front Matter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Be sure to put it on a new line.</li>
  <li class="li4">If all goes well, you can now open your html output file, <span class="s2">mystory.html</span>, in a browser, and read your story interactively.</li>
  <li class="li4">You can change story format at the twee2 command line.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For example, you may need the SugarCube format to import twee files that include the old style of Twine scripting:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span class="s2">twee2 build mystory.txt mystory.html --format=SugarCube</span></li>
  <li class="li4">You can also open the html file in Twine 2, at <a href="http://twinery.org/2/">http://twinery.org/2/</a>, or in a downloadable version of Twine 2.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is an friendlier way to change the story format than at the command line.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Making Changes</p>
<p class="p4">There are various minor changes you can make to the settings to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4"><b>Project and author name:</b> The default book title and author name used in headers and elsewhere can be customized by going to Project &gt; Meta-Data Settings… and choosing the “Project Properties” tab.</li>
  <li class="li4"><b>Character and setting sketch sheets</b> and other helpful Scrivener sections have not been included in this template, but they can be dragged into your story file from another template or project that includes them, if desired.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Be sure not to drag them into the Draft section.</li>
  <li class="li4"><b>Making your own special folders:</b> The “Research” folder is just a regular folder that has been set up in a particular way, and you are free to create other folders that work in a similar manner.
  <ol class="ol1">
    <li class="li4">To create a folder with a custom icon, add a new folder, place it where you want it, ensure it is selected, and then go to Documents &gt; Change Icon to choose a different icon.</li>
    <li class="li4">To create your own template sheets, simply create a new document inside the “Template Sheets” folder and set it up however you want (whether by adding text, changing the title, setting default meta-data, or whatever). Now this document will be available as the basis of new documents from the New From Template menu. (You can add a custom icon to this if you so wish, too.)</li>
    <li class="li4">To set things up so that when the special folder created in (1) is selected and you hit “Add”, a new document based on the one you set up in (2) is created, select the folder and go to Documents &gt; Default New Subdocument Type and select the special template document you created.</li>
  </ol></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Import/Export</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">To import an existing twee or twee2 text file, you can use Scrivener's Import and Split option, splitting on the :: character sequence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(If the twee file does not have a .txt extension, you may need to change it to .txt or change your Scrivener preferences to accept the twee extension.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This will cause your titles to be duplicated inside the text documents and you will need to delete that duplicate text.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Alternately, you can use a text editor to change all occurrences of :: in the source file to ##, and then import with the Multimarkdown importer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In either case,<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>
  <ul class="ul2">
    <li class="li4">All scenes will be imported at the same level. (You can rearrange them afterwards.)</li>
    <li class="li4">Some non-story nodes may also be imported; these should be deleted.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li class="li4">To import an existing Twine 2 story file, use Twee2's decompile option to create a twee2 text file (then import the text file as above):<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span class="s2">twee decompile mytwine2story.html mytwine2story.txt</span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">If you import a Twine 2 story or a twee2 text file with position codes, the position codes will appear in text document titles.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These are harmless, but note that they are not part of the link text.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In that case, you should use the Twee<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>compile option to preserve the existing position codes.</li>
  <li class="li4">The Twee2 compile option generates somewhat random layout position codes for import into Twine 2.</li>
  <li class="li4">You can go back and forth between Scrivener and Twine 2 in this way, but note that any hierarchical structure to the drafts folder and any corkboard entries will not be preserved.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Scripting and Styling</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">Gamebook scripting (e.g., using variables to track user inventory) is supported by Scree and Twee2; just add the appropriate script to the individual text document where you want it to run.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Note that the scripting language is determined by your choice of story format; you can read more about scripting in the Twine wiki: <a href="https://twinery.org/wiki/">https://twinery.org/wiki/</a>.</li>
  <li class="li4">Likewise, the different story formats have different ways of altering the default style of the HTML output or of a particular story node which you can read about in the Twine wiki.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Twee2 also has extensive styling support that you can read about in the Twee2 documentation: <a href="http://twee2.danq.me/documentation.html">http://twee2.danq.me/documentation.html</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">Twee2 supports using your own format instead of the pre-packaged ones.</li>
  <li class="li4">If you are working with an old twee story, the story format you probably want is SugarCube.</li>
</ul>
