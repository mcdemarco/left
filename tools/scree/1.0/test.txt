::StoryTitle
TEST

::Start <10,110>

The internal title of the starting scene should be Start.  It's written in plain text, with only markdown formatting allowed.

This scene ends with some choices, to which we navigate using internal names for the linked scenes:

* Go to [[Scene 2]].
* Go to [[The End]].

::Scene 2 <110,210>

This scene offers readers some more choices.  They can [[go back to a previous scene using an inline, descriptive link->Start]], a short inline link like [[Start]], or with links at the end like they saw before.

* Go back to [[Start]].
* Go on to [[Scene 3]].
* [[You can also go to the next section using a descriptive title for the reader.->Scene 3]]
* [[Scene 2a<-You can format the longer link in either direction.]]
* Go to [[The End]].

::Scene 2a <20,120>

A digression.

* Go back to [[Scene 2]].

::Scene 3 <30,110>

Feel free to structure your story in Scrivener as you wish.  You can put all your scenes at the top level, or divide them into sections and even subsections.  All text sections will be complied; into story nodes.  Any folder names and notes will be ignored.

* Go to [[The End]].

::The End <340,340>

The End is nigh!

*The end.*
