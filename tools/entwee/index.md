Entwee is my one-time-use story format for exporting a Twine 2 story into the old twee format, based on Michael McCollum's similar story format, [Entweedle](http://www.maximumverbosity.net/twine/Entweedle/).  This is a task that can also be accomplished with twees, but the story format only requires interacting with the Twine GUI, not the command-line.  On the down side, like PrePub, it creates is an HTML file that in turn creates the plain text twee file, which may or may not save automatically depending on your browser.

### Installation

To add Entwee to Twine 2, use this URL (under Formats > Add a New Format): `https://mcdemarco.net/tools/entwee/format.js`   

### Versions

The current version is 1.1.0, which outputs a twee file with Unix newlines.

The previous version was 1.0.1, which output Windows linefeeds.  If you have trouble with the current version, you can install the previous with the URL: `https://mcdemarco.net/tools/entwee/1.0.1/format.js`
