This page began as [a blog post](/blog/2016/10/19/state-of-hyperfiction/) that I felt the need to update frequently because there's just never been a good word for hyperfiction.  Besides the definitions and sources mentioned below, there was also a software section that now has [its own page](/tools/hyperfic/software.html).  (The [History of Choice Mapping](/blog/2017/10/27/history-of-choice-mapping/) is still in the blog.)

The biggest pitfall of interactive fiction is figuring out what to call it, because *interactive fiction* is a uselessly generic term.  The many bad names for interactive fiction frequently imply that a work is a literary form when it's really a computer game, or vice versa.  What any particular term in the hyperfictionary says to you is often not what it said to the writers who slapped it on their work for want of anything better.  So I made a little thesaurus with the help of [the SF encyclopedia](http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/gamebook) and many examples found in the wild:

* **Hyperfiction** is fiction with hyperlinks, traditionally at the end of a scene or page but sometimes inline instead.  Usually the story is told in the second person and the reader determines the plot through your quantized choices.
  * The canonical example is the Choose Your Own Adventure series of children's books.
  * Hyperfiction is also known as *hypertext fiction*, *hypertext IF*, *hypertexts*, *hyperstories*, *branching-path books*, *interactive novels*, *wovels*, *CYOA*, *cybertext*, *choice-based games*, etc.
  * Sometimes *hypertext* is distinguished from *CYOA* based on whether the links appear inline or at the end of a scene.
* **Gamebooks** combine hyperfiction with RPG-style game rules, implemented in dead-tree books by the reader rolling dice, etc., or in the background on computers.
  * The term was apparently coined by Steve Jackson for the canonical example of the genre:  the Fighting Fantasy series of books.
  * Gamebooks are also known as *adventure gamebooks*, *multiple-choice games*, *multiple-choice gamebooks*, *MCGs*, *storygames*, etc.  Gamebooks using an existing RPG system are also known as *role-playing solitaire adventures*.  Collaborative gamebooks are also known as *addventure*.  **QBN**, or *quality-based narrative*, is a style that links your stats to your access to parts of the narrative, usually invisibly unlike in traditional gamebooks, and also usually in an exploratory way as in parser fiction.
  * *Gamebooks* are sometimes considered to include *CYOA* books. 
* **Interactive fiction** is fiction in which the reader directs the story using (somewhat) natural language.  They traditionally involve free exploration of a map, collecting items, and puzzle solving.
  * The canonical example is the Zork series of video games.
  * Interactive fiction is abbreviated *IF* or *int-fiction* and is also known as *text adventures*, *adventure games*, *parser games*, or *parser(-based) IF*.
  * *Narrative games* is a more general term that may include the previous categories as well.

Further afield you find *visual novels*, not to mention a different sort of *CYOA* that's [almost entirely unrelated](/blog/2018/06/24/cyoa-whazzit/) to interactive fiction.  It's best not to go further afield.

### Finding Hyperfiction

Dead-tree gamebooks, including CYOA, are thorougly catalogued at [Demian's Gamebook Web Page](https://gamebooks.org).  Many such books are available from Amazon, but, there being no accepted term for the genre, there is no reliable way to search for them.

[The Interactive Fiction Database](http://ifdb.tads.org) covers a mix of IF and hyperfiction, making it hard to search for hypertext in particular as well as for stories that are available online (as opposed to for downloading).  You can try searching by engine, e.g., [system:ChoiceScript](http://ifdb.tads.org/search?searchfor=system%3AChoiceScript&searchgo=Search+Games), or opening up the engine list under system:*name* on the [search page](http://ifdb.tads.org/search?game) and clicking on an engine you're interested in---no matter how [obscure](https://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=ig3zbeoqfv4v1xl8).

You can shop for phone app gamebooks at [Gamebook Adventures](http://gamebookadventures.com/gamebooks/), [Cubus Games](http://www.cubusgames.com), or [Inkle](http://www.inklestudios.com/), or buy a [more serious work of hyperfiction](http://www.eastgate.com/catalog/Fiction.html) at Eastgate.  For some curation before buying, try [Gamebook News](http://gamebooknews.com) for the latest, [Adventure Gamers](http://www.adventuregamers.com) for reviews, or this list of the [10 best gamebook apps](http://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-gamebook-apps,review-2419.html).

You can read online games at several community-oriented hyperfiction writing websites noted in my [software list](/tools/hyperfic/software.html).  These usually have some sort of curated category and/or ratings system, unless otherwise noted.

When people ask for a Twine story recommendation, I point them to *[You Will Select a Decision](https://selectadecision.info) (Сделайте Свой Выбор), The great classic of Kyrgyz young adult interactive socialist literature*.
