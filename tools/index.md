I have a few writing tools on my site, though nothing to compare to [donjon's site](http://donjon.bin.sh).

My Scrivener template, [Scree](/tools/scree/), is for writing hyperfiction gamebooks in Scrivener, for publication using Twee/Twine.  I've made a few story formats for Twine as well: [Paloma](/tools/scree/paloma/), a Jonah replacement for Twine 2, [DotGraph](/tools/scree/dotgraph/), a proofing format for displaying your Twine story nodes as a graph, and [entwee](/tools/entwee/) and [enscree](/tools/scree/enscree/), one-time-use formats for exporting a Twine 2 story into, respectively, the old twee format and a related format used by Scree.

The [Random Family Tree Generator](/tools/family-tree-generator/) is a product of NaNoWriMo 2013, during which I wanted to populate several dwarf clans, fast.

My [sffms package](/sffms/) is a LaTeX document class for writing speculative fiction that I maintained for many years.


### Miscellany

My app.net app [Paste](http://paste-app.net) is a pinboard-style app that I sometimes use to collect writing links.  It's hosted at Amazon, but I [blogged about it](/blog/2013/09/13/paste/) here.  I also wrote a simpler app.net app, [Crick Ticker](http://crick-ticker.mcdemarco.net/), for setting stream markers on Alpha, the app.net microblogging service.  My latest app.net app, [Market Bucket](http://market-bucket.mcdemarco.net), is a shopping list app that I also use for my to-read list.

I wrote a reading tool, a [bicolorization bookmarklet](/bicolorize/), along with some revisions to an existing bicolored Tetris game, intended for use with anaglyph glasses.  As usual, there are more details [in the blog](/blog/2014/10/26/bicolorize/).

I've also made a few [gaming tools](/games/), and some [bookmarklets](/tools/colourlets/) for the ColourLovers website.
