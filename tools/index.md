I have a few writing tools on my site, though nothing to compare to [donjon's site](http://donjon.bin.sh).  My [sffms package](/sffms/) is a LaTeX document class for writing speculative fiction that I've maintained for many years.  The [Random Family Tree Generator](/tools/family-tree-generator/) is a product of NaNoWriMo 2013, during which I wanted to populate several dwarf clans, fast.

My app.net app, [Paste](http://paste-app.net), is a pinboard-style app that I sometimes use to collect writing links.  It's hosted at Amazon, but I [blogged about it](/blog/2013/09/13/paste/) here.
