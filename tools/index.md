I have a few writing tools on my site, though nothing to compare to [donjon's site](http://donjon.bin.sh).

My Scrivener template, [Scree](/tools/scree/), is for writing hyperfiction gamebooks in Scrivener, for publication using Twee/Twine.  I've made a few story formats for Twine as well: [Paloma](/tools/scree/paloma/), a Jonah replacement for Twine 2, [DotGraph](/tools/scree/dotgraph/), a proofing format for displaying your Twine story nodes as a graph, and a few conversion formats.  For more details see the [Scree](/tools/scree/) or [Twine tools](/tools/twine.html) pages.

The [Random Family Tree Generator](/tools/family-tree-generator/) is a product of NaNoWriMo 2013, during which I wanted to populate several dwarf clans, fast.

My [sffms package](/sffms/) is a LaTeX document class for writing speculative fiction that I maintained for many years.


### Miscellany

My latest creation is [CardPen](http://cardpen.mcdemarco.net/), a tool for creating playing cards and other large-format game images in your browser using HTML, CSS, and Mustache.  It's intended for DIY or low-volume commercial printing; high-volume printing usually requires formats other than PNG.  The [examples page](http://cardpen.mcdemarco.net/doc/examples.html) shows the sorts of things I've done with it, and of course I [blogged about](http://jekyll.mcdemarco.net/blog/2017/07/20/cardpenned/) making yet another piece of software to do something people already do.

My app.net app [Paste](http://paste.mcdemarco.net) is a pinboard-style app that I sometimes use to collect writing links.  It was hosted at Amazon in the days of app.net; it is now running on [pnut.io](https://pnut.io/); I first blogged about it [here](/blog/2013/09/13/paste/).   My last app.net app, [Market Bucket](http://market-bucket.mcdemarco.net), is a shopping list app that I still use today on pnut.io.  I also wrote a simpler app.net app, [Crick Ticker](http://crick-ticker.mcdemarco.net/), for setting stream markers on Alpha, the app.net microblogging service, which I haven't ported to pnut.io, so it does nothing at the moment.

I wrote a reading tool, a [bicolorization bookmarklet](/bicolorize/), along with some revisions to an existing bicolored Tetris game, intended for use with anaglyph glasses.  As usual, there are more details [in the blog](/blog/2014/10/26/bicolorize/).

I've also made some [bookmarklets](/tools/colourlets/) for the ColourLovers website, and enough [games and gaming tools](/games/) that they deserve their own page.
