<p>Normally, LaTeX source files use the pairs of characters
<kbd>``</kbd> and <kbd>''</kbd> to represent open and close quotation
marks.  A LaTeX-aware text editor such as <a href="Emacs.html"
>emacs</a> will insert these characters automatically when
<kbd>"</kbd> is typed.</p>

<h2>quotation mark options in sffms</h2>

<p>Sffms includes two options for changing quotation mark style, which
are explained in the documentation.  Their main purpose is to handle
legacy quotation marks in text files.  The <kbd>smart</kbd> option
will smarten dumb quotes, and is most useful in conjunction with the
<kbd>nonsubmission</kbd> option.  The <kbd>dumb</kbd> option
will dumb down LaTeX quotes, and is most useful in a file with mixed
LaTeX and dumb quotes.</p>

<p>There's a txt2latex perl script available from CTAN at <a href="https://www.ctan.org/pkg/txt2latex">https://www.ctan.org/pkg/txt2latex</a> that will convert quotes in the source text permanently, but it's not very smart about it and will require some hand-editing after the fact.
<p>

<p>Note that none of these approaches will handle "smart quotes" of
the traditional non-ascii sort.  Be sure to convert legacy files to
plain text before sending them through LaTeX.</p>
