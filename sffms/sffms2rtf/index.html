<h3>rtf converter</h3>

<p>This is a beta version of a forthcoming sffms to rtf converter.
Upload a story file (e.g., <a href="/sffms/examples/oveja.tex"
>oveja.tex</a>) and it will returned to you in Rich Text Format.
Since this is a beta, you should edit the output in a word processor
before emailing it to anyone.</p>

<p>Text that the converter could not interpret will be marked in <span style="color:
red;">red</span>.  The output file will have the extension <tt>.rtf</tt>
and may be downloaded automatically, depending on your browser.  No
copy of your story is saved on the server.</p>
