<p>This directory contains all files associated with SFFMS, the LaTeX
SF/F manuscript class, version 2.1.  Older versions are archived in
the <a href="previous/" >previous/</a> directory.</p>

<p>If you're not sure which files
you need, then take the tarfile: <a href="sffms.tar.gz"
>sffms.tar.gz</a>. (Both WinZip and Stuffit should be able to open it.)</p>

<h2>the manual</h2>

<p>The <a href="sffms.pdf" >manual</a> is <em>not</em> included in the
tarfile.  If you don't 
know how to generate it from the <kbd>dtx</kbd> file, then download
it separately as <a href="sffms.pdf" >pdf</a> or <a href="sffms.ps"
>postscript</a>.  See the <a href="/sffms/info/" >info</a> directory for more help.</p>


<h2>the examples</h2>

<p>One example, <a href="/sffms/examples/blind.tex" >In the Country of
the Blind</a> by H.G. Wells, is included in the tarfile.  See the <a href="/sffms/examples/" >examples</a> directory for more information.</p>
