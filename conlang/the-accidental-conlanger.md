This may look like yet another blog post, but in fact it is the opening page of a book (in the [Drupal](http://drupal.org/node/284) sense) about conlanging for writers.  *The Accidental Conlanger* will provide both an overview of constructed languages in fiction and practical advice for doing it yourself.

On a technical note, Drupal will automatically populate the navigation section below as content is added.  New book pages will appear on the main page and in the main rss feed, but not in the blog rss feed.  All content is original, unless otherwise noted.  All rights reserved, etc.
