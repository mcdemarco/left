This may look like yet another blog post, but in fact it is the opening page of a book I started writing a while back (see [the original title page](the-accidental-conlanger.html)) about conlanging for writers.  *The Accidental Conlanger* provides both an overview of constructed languages in fiction and practical advice for doing it yourself.  All content is original, unless otherwise noted.  All rights reserved, etc.
