Experimental languages are both the most excessive form of conlang and the most excusable, because an experimental language often provides the [novum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novum) of the story in which it appears.  Usually this has something to do with the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis:  the idea that language influences thought, so that different language speakers *think* differently in some sense.  At the least, an experimental language reflects some unusual linguistic possibilities.

Klingon, constructed by linguist Marc Okrand for use in several *Star Trek* movies, is an agglutinative experimental language which flouts various near-universals (of word order and phonology) and takes the most alien path whenever possible.  You can watch [his talk about constructing Klingon](http://community.livejournal.com/conlangs/419781.html) on YouTube.

Marc Okrand also invented the [Atlantean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantean_language) Ur-language for a Disney film.  The concerns of writers are somewhat different than those of screenwriters, who can afford to hire a linguist for the atmosphere, so this chapter will focus on experimental languages that have appeared in books.
