I've made a couple of [gaming tools](/games/kb/) for my favorite board game, Kingdom Builder: a [board generator](/games/kb/board-builder.html) and [an updated random layout generator](/games/kb/randomizer.html).  See the first link for more details.

I've also worked on some tools for the game 504: an [almanac](/games/504/almanac/) and some improvements to the standard rules generator; see [the 504 page](/games/504/) for more details.

I've implemented [a few solitaire games](/games/decktet/) for the Decket, an alternative card system by P.D. Magnus.

At the last minute before traipsing off to dance camp last year I rethemed the game [10 Days in Beautiful Africa](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/7865/10-days-africa) into [10 Hours in Beautiful Pinewoods](/games/10hours/).

Much earlier than the last minute before dance camp this year, I made a tool, [CardPen](http://cardpen.mcdemarco.net/) for printing card (and other) games, and printed up two [of them](http://cardpen.mcdemarco.net/doc/examples.html).

I made another small use of the BoardGameGeek API besides the game list option in CardPen:  some [sorting utilities](/games/bgg/), including a [geeklist sorter](/games/bgg/geeklist.html), a [family sorter](/games/bgg/family.html), and a [general thing sorter](/games/bgg/things.html).
