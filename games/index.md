I've made a couple of [gaming tools](/games/kb/) for my favorite board game, Kingdom Builder: a [board generator](/games/kb/board-builder.html) and [an updated random layout generator](/games/kb/randomizer.html).  See the first link for more details.

I've also worked on some tools for the game 504: an [almanac](/games/504/almanac/) and some improvements to the standard rules generator; see [the 504 page](/games/504/) for more details.

I've implemented [a few solitaire games](/games/decktet/) for the Decket, an alternative card system by P.D. Magnus.

At the last minute before traipsing off to dance camp this year I rethemed the game [10 Days in Beautiful Africa](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/7865/10-days-africa) into [10 Hours in Beautiful Pinewoods](/games/10hours/).
