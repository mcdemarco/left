Icehouse pieces, a.k.a. [Looney pyramids](https://www.looneylabs.com/pyramids-home), are stackable pyramids of three sizes and many colors, invented by John Cooper and Andrew Looney for the game Icehouse.

## Rules and Tools

I've put together some rules summaries, randomizers and scoresheets for pyramid games:

* [Zoning Out Randomizer](https://mcdemarco.github.io/321/zoningoutrandomizer.html), randomizes the random special rules for this Sprawlopolis-like game as well as the three draw bags, and includes a scoresheet and rules summary.
* a [Pyramid Randomizer](https://mcdemarco.github.io/321/pyramidrandomizer.html) based on the code I wrote to randomize the draw bags for Zoning Out.
* [Dectana Deciphered](/games/decktet/dectana/) includes a player aid for this Zarcana-like game similar to the official one, but with more pretty pictures.

## Geeklists

I've compiled some pyramid geeklists for reference:

* [Pyramid Arcade Games](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/333293/pyramid-arcade-games), games in the Pyramid Arcade, the Quartet, or the Sandships mailing.
* [Pyramid Arcade Extra Games](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/333336/pyramid-arcade-extra-games), the 22 extra games not included in the box, plus the 6 fan favorites not included in the 22 extras.
* [The Arcana](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/333402/arcana), my history and taxonomy of Zarcana-like games.
* [Am I a Starship Captain?](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/333078/am-i-starship-captain), my Starship Captain list, such as it is

## My Games

I've half-designed a few pyramid games based on other games, mostly as an intellectual exercise.  They have not yet been fully playtested.

### Darcana

Darcana is an unpublished work in progress along the lines of Dectana, but with more Gnostica and less Zark City.

### Deck Town

[Deck Town](/games/decktet/decktown/) is based on [Zark City](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/35003/zark-city), a [Zarcana](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/10996/zarcana) for the rest of us by Andrew Looney.  I devised it in order to work my way up to actually playing [Dectana](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/60015/dectana) (after having merely [deciphered](/games/decktet/dectana/) it).

### Somids

[Somids](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3264456/somids) is a variant of Nomids designed for my pyramid-hungry toddler who refuses to shed.
