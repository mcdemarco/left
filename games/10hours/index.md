I made a 10 Days-style game for a dance camp where I like to sit on the porch and play games.  You can read more about the process [in the blog](/blog/2016/07/15/10-hours/), or download the files here.  In addition to the files, you will need a set of racks from a 10 Days game and either cardstock or card sleeves to make the tiles stiff enough to stand in the rack.
