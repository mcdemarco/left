[Kingdom Builder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Builder) is my favorite board game; at one point I was inspired to generate random Kingdom Builder boards.  I included the generator in [a blog post](/blog/2013/05/21/kingdom-board-builder/), but you can also find it on [a separate page here](board-builder.html).  There's also a version for [Winter Kingdom](winter-board-builder.html).

I updated an existing random layout generator for Kingdom Builder to include more expansions; read more about [it](/blog/2014/12/10/kingdom-builder-randomizer) and its latest [update](/blog/2017/06/17/harvest-randomizer/) in the blog, or just use it to [generate a layout](randomizer.html) for your game.
