[The Decktet](http://www.decktet.com) is an alternative deck of cards created by P.D. Magnus and released under a CC license.


## Online Games

I've implemented or updated a few solitaire games for the Decktet:

* [Adaman](http://mcdemarco.github.io/adaman/), an update to the JavaScript implementation for Adaman by Felbrigg Herriot.  Adaman is a unique solitaire game of controlling the Decktet personality cards by P.D. Magnus.
* [Cascades](http://mcdemarco.net/games/decktet/cascades/), a solitaire card game for the Decktet by Joe Conard.
* [Myrmex](http://mcdemarco.github.io/myrmex/), my implementation of Greg James' Decktet version of the classic solitaire game Spider; all of his variants are supported.
* [Aucteraden](/games/decktet/aucteraden/), a Decktet solitaire game by Jack Neal, includes a scoresheet, rules, and the game, including some variants invented, accidentally and otherwise, at BoardGameGeek.  (The scoresheet doesn't work in some older browsers, but the [game itself](/games/decktet/aucteraden/aucteraden.html) does.)

I only dimly recall my reasons for updating Adaman; I think they were mainly stylistic.  Myrmex I wanted to be able play without breaking out my double Decktet deck.  Cascades was a little experiment with a lightweight JavaScript framework called [mithril](http://mithril.js.org).  Aucteraden was easy to play but hard to score.


## Rules and Tools

I've put together some rules summaries, scoresheets, and/or rollers for existing Decktet games:

* [Aucteraden](/games/decktet/aucteraden/) includes a scoresheet and rules summary.

* [Dectana Deciphered](/games/decktet/dectana/) includes a player aid similar to the official one, but with more pretty pictures.

* [Magnate Roller](/games/decktet/magnate/) is a tool I made to replace my missing D&D dice when playing the two-player Decktet game [Magnate](http://decktet.wikidot.com/game:magnate); it interprets resource and taxation results for you, shows the roll outcomes, and includes a rules summary.

* [Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy](/games/decktet/ttss/) is a rules summary.

## My Games

I've half-designed a few games for the Decktet based on other games, mostly as an intellectual exercise.  They have not yet been fully playtested.

### Buttle

[Buttle](/games/decktet/buttle/) is a two-player game based on the traditional(ish) card game Cuttle, inspired by a previous reimplementation of it for the Decktet by Oshojabe at Reddit.

### The Badger on the Borderland

[The Badger on the Borderland](/games/decktet/bb/) is based on [The Fox in the Forest](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/221965/fox-forest), a two-player trick taking game which you can also [play with traditional playing cards](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/153033/fox-forest-summary-sheet).

### Deck Town

[Deck Town](/games/decktet/decktown/) is based on [Zark City](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/35003/zark-city), a [Zarcana](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/10996/zarcana) for the rest of us by Andrew Looney.  I devised it in order to work my way up to actually playing [Dectana](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/60015/dectana) (after having merely [deciphered](/games/decktet/dectana/) it).

### Personimo

I'm also working on a game of my own for the Decktet.  [Personimo](/games/decktet/personimo/) is a badgerized version of the popular board game [Kingdomino](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/204583/kingdomino).  There is no implementation so far, only rules.

### Sapphire Towers

Sapphire Towers is a [variant](https://boardgamegeek.com/article/31346416#31346416) of Steven Grady's [Bel√©m](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/899288/nice-spider-adaptation-plus-idea-similar-seahaven), an adaptation of Sea(haven) Towers to the Decktet.  Sapphire Towers uses the full expanded Myrmex deck, 9 columns, and 2 cells.
