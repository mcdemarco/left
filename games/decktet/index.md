[The Decktet](http://www.decktet.com) is an alternative deck of cards created by P.D. Magnus and released under a CC license.

I've implemented or updated a few solitaire games for the Decktet:

* [Adaman](http://mcdemarco.github.io/adaman/), an update to the JavaScript implementation for Adaman by Felbrigg Herriot.  Adaman is a unique solitaire game of controlling the Decktet personality cards by P.D. Magnus.
* [Cascades](http://mcdemarco.net/games/decktet/cascades/), a solitaire card game for the Decktet by Joe Conard.
* [Myrmex](http://mcdemarco.github.io/myrmex/), my implementation of Greg James' Decktet version of the classic solitaire game Spider; all of his variants are supported.

I only dimly recall my reasons for updating Adaman; I think they were mainly stylistic.  Myrmex I wanted to be able play without breaking out my double Decktet deck.  Cascades was a little experiment with lightweight JavaScript framework called [mithril](http://mithril.js.org).

I also made a little tool to replace my missing D&D dice when playing the two-player Decktet game [Magnate](http://decktet.wikidot.com/game:magnate), using Vue.js:

* [Magnate Roller](magnate/) determines resource and taxation results for you, shows the roll outcomes, and has a rules summary
