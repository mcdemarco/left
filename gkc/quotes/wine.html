<p class="by">A quote from <a href="https://ccel.org/ccel/chesterton/heretics">Heretics</a>
Chapter VII: "Omar and the Sacred Vine"</p>

<p>Some one called Omar "the sad, glad old Persian."
Sad he is; glad he is not, in any sense of the word whatever.
He has been a worse foe to gladness than the Puritans.</p>

<p>A pensive and graceful Oriental lies under the rose-tree
with his wine-pot and his scroll of poems. It may seem strange
that any one's thoughts should, at the moment of regarding him,
fly back to the dark bedside where the doctor doles out brandy.
It may seem stranger still that they should go back
to the grey wastrel shaking with gin in Houndsditch.
But a great philosophical unity links the three in an evil bond.
Omar Khayyam's wine-bibbing is bad, not because it is wine-bibbing.
It is bad, and very bad, because it is medical wine-bibbing. It
is the drinking of a man who drinks because he is not happy.
His is the wine that shuts out the universe, not the wine that reveals it.
It is not poetical drinking, which is joyous and instinctive;
it is rational drinking, which is as prosaic as an investment,
as unsavoury as a dose of camomile.  ... He feasts
because life is not joyful; he revels because he is not glad.
"Drink," he says, "for you know not whence you come nor why.
Drink, for you know not when you go nor where. Drink, because the
stars are cruel and the world as idle as a humming-top. Drink,
because there is nothing worth trusting, nothing worth fighting for.
Drink, because all things are lapsed in a base equality and an
evil peace." So he stands offering us the cup in his hand.</p>
