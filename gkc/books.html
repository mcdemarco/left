<p>The American Chesterton Society has a <a href="https://www.chesterton.org/bibliography-for-beginners/">good bibliography</a> for beginners.</p>

<p>I've assembled a non-representative sample of Chesterton in the <a href="quotes/" >quotes section</a>.  There is much, much more
available on-line:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The clearinghouse for Chesterton works online is <a href="http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/">Martin Ward's
      G. K. Chesterton Page</a>, including such rarities as <a href="http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/whats_wrong.html"><em>What's Wrong With the World</em></a> and <a href="http://www.gkc.org.uk/gkc/books/manalive/man_toc.html"><em>Manalive</em></a>.</li> 
  <li>You can find several books online a variety of formats at <a href="http://www.ccel.org/c/chesterton/">Wheaton College</a>, including:  <em>The Innocence of
    Father Brown</em> and <em>The Wisdom of Father Brown</em> two
    collections of Father Brown mysteries; the novels <em>The Club of
    Queer Trades</em> and <em>The Man Who Was Thursday</em>;
		<a href="https://ccel.org/ccel/chesterton/heretics"><em>Heretics</em></a>,
      a collection of essays against the iconoclasts of the day and 
		<a href="https://ccel.org/ccel/chesterton/orthodoxy"><em>Orthodoxy</em></a>,
      which is both a sequel to <em>Heretics</em> and an <em>apologia
      pro vita sua</em>.</li>
  <li>The illustrated <a
    href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020220130615/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/browse-mixed-new?id=CheTols&tag=public&images=images/modeng&data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed"><em>Leo Tolstoy</em></a> (Wayback Machine) was available from the <a href="https://dcs.library.virginia.edu/digital-stewardship-services/etext/">Electronic Text Center</a>.</li>
  <li>Mitsuharu Matsuoka provides the texts of <a
    href="http://victorian-studies.net/CD-Chesterton-CD.html"><em>Charles
    Dickens</em></a> and <a
    href="http://victorian-studies.net/CD-Chesterton-A&C.html"><em>Appreciations
    and Criticisms of the Works of Charles Dickens</em></a> as part of
    his <a
    href="http://victorian-studies.net/Dickens.html">Dickens
    Page</a>.</li> 
</ul>

<p>Chesterton's collected works are being published by <a
href="http://www.ignatius.com/">Ignatius Press</a>.  Anyone with
access to a university library should be able to dig up some real
gems:  <em>The Outline of Sanity</em>, <em>Robert Browning</em>,
<em>St. Thomas Aquinas</em> or my favorite novel, <em>The Napoleon of
Notting Hill</em>.  The latter two are currently in print.</p>
