<h2>A Reply to Praise of the Essay</h2>

<p>I'm flattered by John Peterson's response, though I can hardly hope to
have destroyed "Urban Distributism" with my brief essay ("Against 'The
American Distributist' by Daniel Krotz", GS, December 1996).  And of
course I too must quibble:</p> 
 
<p>The reluctance of most distributivists to return to the land is not quite
so problematic as Mr. Peterson has implied.  Agrarianism is for the young
and romantic - one can hardly expect hoary old Chestertonians to leave off
puffing on their cigars to milk cows.  They can do their duty by
bankrolling and inspiring the next generation in distributivist projects. 
More importantly, our shining example of distribution, medieval agrarian
society, is not the only logical possibility.  If all of the means of
production in our modern world were distributed (rather than centralized),
much more than the arable land would be in the hands of the populace,
and the cow-shy could easily find a place in the just society.</p> 
 
<p>On a minor point, I wish to add that I never said I did not advocate
violent dispossession of the Capitalists.  I merely failed to advocate it
in this peaceful forum, instead suggesting milder methods of
redistribution where Mr. Krotz disavowed redistribution entirely.  Mr.
Peterson, quite understandably, misses another subtle point:  to the
question of the soul I added a biblical quote by which I hoped to imply
that even in the religious camp immortality had not always been taken for
granted.  (Ecclesiastes 9:5 gives an even clearer dissenting opinion.) 
Distributivists have more pressing concerns than the resolution of age-old
controversies by fiat.</p>

<p>I agree that a flourishing true religion should lead to a just society,
but, no evangelist myself, I must take the hard political road to the
non-servile state instead.  While a distributivist philosophy should
assert that the spiritual and economic improvements we all desire must go
hand-in-hand, redistribution itself is primarily an economic enterprise
that can and should be undertaken in a catholic, rather than Catholic,
spirit.</p> 
 
<p>Lastly, in an age when the air is full of philosophies which assert the
relativism of belief regardless of the implied contradiction, Mr. Peterson
should allow Mr. Krotz to clear Distributivism of such a crime in peace.</p> 
 

<h2>A Reply to Criticism of the Essay</h2>

<p>	I must agree with Mr. Rockett that my prose was entirely
unpersuasive and unclear.  How else could he have though that I was
insisting upon "third-party or intermediate property transfers" as the
sole means of redistribution, when the only serious suggestion in my
article was rather "restoring the land to the people one family at a
time, by private means"?  I am curious how Mr. Rockett expects his
Buddhist monks & company to distribute filthy lucre which is not
legally theirs, if not by some intermediate transfer of said property.
This is not the age, I beg to remind him, of robber-barons and
scrooges capable of repenting and turning their ill-gotten fortunes to
better ends.  It is not in the nature of multinational corporations to
sell off their holdings at the homey county auctions he envisions.</p>

<p>	I am but a poor wage-slave, furtively typing my dogmatic 
distributivist tracts on my master's computer.  I must apologize to Mr. 
Rockett if my duties called me away before I could polish every rough spot 
of my argument.  I hoped mainly to counter Mr. Krotz' idea of a back-yard
Distributivism lacking redistribution of any sort; formulating a plan for
effective redistribution was more than I had hoped to accomplish.  
Yet I will not apologize for what Mr. Rockett called "glib appeals
to thinly-disguised Secularism."  A religious girl living 
in a secular society must make a rational, even secular, case for her pet 
political philosophy if she expects to get a hearing.  There will always 
be the option of converting the entire nation to her own religion and 
then making a religious argument for Distributivism, yet I doubt Mr. Rockett 
wants to be converted.</p>

<p>	Libellous accusations of Secularism cannot prove Mr. Krotz' 
assertion that Distributivism "always concludes in belief in a soul" for 
him, and if Mr. Rockett truly objects to the Separation of
Distributivism and Religion let him show that Islam, for instance, is not 
just as compatible with Distributivism as his or Mr. Krotz' religion is.</p>
