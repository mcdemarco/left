<blockquote>Are there no calamities in history?  Nothing tragic?
May we never weep over the defeated? ... Must we always desert the cause
as soon as fortune forsakes it, and bind ourselves to the cause which is in
the ascendant, and hurrah in the crowd that throw up their caps in honor of
the conqueror? <cite>Orestes Brownson, 1843</cite></blockquote>

<p> Also known as distributism and distributionism, distributivism is
a political philosophy similar to agrarianism.  The means of
production should be distributed as widely as possible among the
populace; they should neither be hoarded by a oligarchy, nor
controlled by the government.  Certainly the means of production
should not be held by the government in the name of fictitious
communal entities, but should be held by individuals in their own
hands, or in the case of land, under their own feet.  For those
projects beyond the scope of an individual or family, a guild system
is recommended.</p>

<p>Although the Distributist League was founded in 1926, distributivist
ideas predate G. K. Chesterton, Distributivism's most famous proponent.  The
turn-of-the-century Populist and arts & crafts movements embraced
distributivistic goals, as did several literary figures of the day.
In more recent times, distributivist ideas have reappeared in the guise
of "back to the land" or "Small is Beautiful" movements.
True distributivists are unopposed to technology per se but are
Luddite in their disgust at machines which disenfranchise people.
Distributivists are not so irrational as to pursue progress for its own sake
nor so immoral as to do so for the gain of a few at the expense of the
many.</p>

<p>The following are extracts from the list of <a href="distbooks.html">references on distributivism</a> in the <a href="http://jkalb.freeshell.org/other/arc_resources.html">alt.revolution.counter resource list</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hilaire Belloc:  <em>The Servile State</em> (1912) attacks both
    socialism and statism.</li>
  <li>Hilaire Belloc:  <em>Restoration of Property</em> (1936) argues
    against both communism and capitalism.</li>
  <li>G.K. Chesterton:  <em>The Outline of Sanity</em> is a classic
    Distributist work arguing for the wide-spread ownership
     of property.  A <a
    href="http://www.aquinas-multimedia.com/catherine/chesterton.html">review of the book</a> for modern-day Catholics appeared in St. Catherine's Review, March/April 1998.</li>
  <li>G. K. Chesterton:  <a
    href="http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/whats_wrong.html"><em>What's Wrong With the World</em></a> (1910)
    doesn't mention distributism as such, but asserts, "We can now
    only avoid Socialism by a change as vast as Socialism. If we are
    to save property, we must distribute property, almost as sternly
    and sweepingly as did the French Revolution."</li>
  <li>Cobbett:  <em>Cottage Economy</em> (1821) provides an alternative
    to the concentration of economic wealth and 
     power in the hands of a few: small businesses and a return to
     honesty and craftsmanship.</li>
  <li>E.F. Schumacher:  <em>Small is Beautiful: A Study of
       Economics as if People Mattered</em></a> (1973) discusses
    the anti-social effects of big business and the need for small
     family properties.</li>

  <li>I wrote an article, <a href="essay.html">Against "The American
  Distributist"</a>, for the December 1996 issue of <em>Generally
  Speaking</em>, and <a href="letters.html">responded</a> to some
  letters to the editor it provoked.</li>
  <li>I also wrote up some <a href="solutions.html">answers</a> to the
  problems with distributism set forth on a web page, now apparently down.</li>
