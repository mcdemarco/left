<p>[This was a response to "Some of the Problems with Distributism" by Antoine Valentim,
which is no longer available on-line.]</p>

<p>First, the political problem of "redistribution" has nothing to do with 
the viability of Distributivism as an economic system.  Distributivism
merely states that property should be distributed - it does not take
credit for the slow Dark Ages decay that brought about the distributivist
system of the Middle Ages, and likewise it need not have a particular
stand on how to achieve a distributed economy today.</p>

<p>To borrow a hippie bromide, there is no way to distributism, distributism
is the way.  I find nothing Bolshevik in repossessing ill-gotten goods;
however, it's not the 1800's anymore so there really aren't robber-barons
to be divested in the classical way.  I believe the most immediate,
effective and promising route to distributivism would be to outlaw the
vicious legal fiction of "incorporation".</p>

<p>Next, the issue of "hog-scratchers" is also political rather than
economic.  Any economic system will have its misfits who for whatever
reason don't play by the rules or fall on hard times.  Capitalism is rife
with its "useless eaters", yet governments (and in the past, fraternal or
religious organizations) have decided to support those people by
non-capitalistic means.  A distributivist state could do the same, with
the same moral dilemmas, even, as you suggest, letting the hog-scratchers
sink into wage-slavery, of all things.</p>

<p>Lastly, distributivism, like other economic systems, is morally loaded.
"For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands:  happy shalt thou be, and
it shall be well with thee."  Just as one man should not live off the 
labour of another, a man should not live off the labour of a machine.  I
can't believe you meant that robot thing seriously, though.</p>

<p>One disturbing thing about your "Problems" is the constant reference to
government intervention.  I consider modern government intervention in
social matters like retirement and unemployment a sign of the decay of   
society under Capitalism.  One reason for replacing Capitalism is this 
very flaw in it which leads to Socialism and worse.</p>
