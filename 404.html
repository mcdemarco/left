<blockquote>
<p>Lúthien Tinúviel<br />
more fair than mortal tongue can tell.<br />
Though all to ruin fell the world<br />
and were dissolved and backward hurled<br />
unmade into the old abyss,<br />
yet were its making good, for this—<br />
the dusk, the dawn, the earth, the sea—<br />
that Lúthien for a time should be.</p>
